  abstract={Post-infectious myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (PI-ME/CFS) is a disabling disorder, yet the clinical phenotype is poorly defined, the pathophysiology is unknown, and no disease-modifying treatments are available. Using rigorous criteria to recruit PI-ME/CFS participants, we conducted deep phenotyping to identify potential disease mechanisms. A defining feature was an alteration of effort preference, rather than physical or central fatigue, due to dysfunction of integrative brain regions potentially associated with central catechol pathway dysregulation. Immune profiling suggested chronic antigenic stimulation with increase in naïve and decrease in switched memory B-cells. Metabolomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid showed alterations in catecholamine and tryptophan pathway metabolites. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated reduced peak oxygen consumption and chronotropic incompetence. These clinical abnormalities and biomarker differences provide unique insight into the underlying pathophysiology and may guide future interventions.}
