  abstract={Post-infectious myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (PI-ME/CFS) is a disabling disorder, yet the clinical phenotype is poorly defined, the pathophysiology is unknown, and no disease-modifying treatments are available. Using rigorous criteria to recruit PI-ME/CFS participants, we conducted deep phenotyping to identify potential disease mechanisms. A defining feature was an alteration of effort preference, rather than physical or central fatigue, due to dysfunction of integrative brain regions potentially associated with central catechol pathway dysregulation. Immune profiling suggested chronic antigenic stimulation with increase in naïve and decrease in switched memory B-cells. Metabolomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid showed alterations in catecholamine and tryptophan pathway metabolites. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated reduced peak oxygen consumption and chronotropic incompetence. These clinical abnormalities and biomarker differences provide unique insight into the underlying pathophysiology and may guide future interventions.}

To investigate concurrent system dysfunctions, we recruited age- and sex-matched ME/CFS patients and healthy controls for a multimodal analysis of energy metabolism, immune profiles, and plasma proteomics. Immune cells from ME/CFS patients show elevated adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) with a reduced ATP/ADP ratio, indicating decreased ATP generation and cellular energy stress. Immune profiling reveals skewing toward less mature effector subsets. Elevated levels of plasma proteins associated with thrombus formation and vascular reactivity may contribute to the endothelial dysfunction observed in ME/CFS patients. Classification and regression tree modeling identifies variables with strong predictive potential for ME/CFS with AUC 0.962, sensitivity 85.2\%, and specificity 96.7\%.},

  abstract={Background: The hallmark symptom of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is post-exertional malaise (PEM) defined as worsening symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion, with symptoms typically worsening 12 to 48 h after activity and lasting for days or even weeks. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides an objective method to evaluate this key symptom via a two-day protocol. Methods: 84 ME/CFS participants (Canadian Criteria) and 71 sedentary controls performed two CPETs separated by 24 h. Test measures included peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), work, heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE), and oxygen pulse (O2 pulse). Results: At rest, ME/CFS showed elevated HR and VE compared to controls. During test 1, ME/CFS demonstrated significantly reduced VO2peak, work, VE, O2 pulse and HR compared to controls (p < 0.001 for all). Following 24 h recovery, ME/CFS participants failed to reproduce CPET-1 measures during CPET-2, showing significant declines in all measures (p < 0.05), while control measures were unchanged. Matched subgroup analysis (n = 55 pairs) confirmed that abnormal responses persisted even when controlling for aerobic capacity. Conclusions: Unlike controls, ME/CFS participants show impaired recovery following an exertional stressor. Abnormal CPET responses cannot be explained by fitness alone and implicate disrupted cardiac, pulmonary, and metabolic factors related to autonomic nervous system dysregulation affecting oxygen delivery for energy metabolism.},

  abstract={Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating illness of unknown pathogenesis. We examined mortality in people with ME/CFS to inform the debate about its long-term prognosis. Methods: We identified patients with a clinical diagnosis of ME/CFS recorded from 2007 to 2013 in primary care records of general practices in England and Wales linked to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We compared mortality in this sample with that of the general population in England and Wales as recorded by the Office for National Statistics. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) overall and for specific causes of death. Findings: Between 2007 and 2013, 2,147 individuals with ME/CFS were identified from CPRD primary care records. 17 deaths occurred during 11,514 person-years of follow-up. The all-cause SMR was 1.14 (95\% CI 0.65-1.85), not significantly different from the general population. The cancer-specific SMR was 1.39 (0.60-2.73) and suicide-specific SMR was 6.85 (2.22-15.98). 60\% of suicide victims had no depression diagnosis. Interpretation: All-cause mortality in ME/CFS patients does not differ significantly from the general population. However, suicide risk is substantially elevated, particularly in individuals without comorbid depression. This finding has important implications for the clinical care and support of people with ME/CFS.}

  abstract={Background: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating and poorly understood illness. This study examined mortality in individuals with chronic fatigue using the National Death Index. Method: The cohort included patients evaluated at one of three specialty fatigue clinics who completed standardized questionnaires and were classified as having CFS (n=285) or chronic fatigue but not CFS (n=263). Clinic records were also searched for deceased patients not identified through the National Death Index. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using US general population rates from 1990–1998. Results: Eleven deaths occurred during 13,153 person-years of follow-up. The all-cause mortality rate was not elevated for CFS or for chronic fatigue. However, the suicide rate was significantly elevated for both groups: SMR 3.6 for CFS and 14.2 for chronic fatigue. Conclusions: Patients with CFS do not have elevated all-cause mortality but do have substantially increased suicide rates, particularly those with chronic fatigue not meeting full CFS criteria. Lack of medical legitimization may contribute to suicide risk.}

  abstract={Background: Despite decades of research into myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), little is known about the mortality rate and causes of death for these patients. Methods: Caregivers of deceased individuals previously diagnosed with ME and/or CFS were recruited through online and offline ME/CFS organizations. They completed questionnaires about their deceased loved ones' age, sex, cause of death, comorbidities, and illness severity. Results: Data from 56 deceased ME/CFS patients were analyzed. Mean age at death was 55.9 years (SD=17.8), significantly younger than the US average of 73.5 years (p<0.0001). 48.2\% were bedridden before death. Leading causes of death: heart failure (29\%), suicide (20\%), and cancer (14\%). Mean age at cardiovascular death was 58.8 years vs. 77.7 in general population (p<0.0001). Conclusions: This memorial record study suggests potential premature mortality in ME/CFS, particularly from cardiovascular causes and suicide. However, selection bias toward severe cases limits generalizability. Population-based registry studies are needed.}

  abstract={Background: Previous memorial record studies have suggested premature mortality in ME/CFS. This study provides an updated analysis with a larger sample. Methods: Analysis of 505 memorial records of deceased ME/CFS patients collected from online memorials, patient organization databases, and caregiver reports from 2015-2024. Results: Mean age at death was 52.5 years (SD=16.7), substantially lower than general population life expectancy. Most frequent causes of death: ME/CFS complications (28.3\%), suicide (25.4\%), cancer (23.0\%), cardiovascular disease (14.2\%). Conclusions: Updated memorial records continue to show patterns of premature mortality, particularly from suicide and potentially cardiovascular causes. However, memorial records inherently overrepresent severe, fatal cases and cannot establish population-level mortality rates. These findings highlight the need for large-scale, population-based mortality studies to definitively characterize ME/CFS mortality patterns.}

Key risk factors: severe functional limitations, lack of social support, medical dismissal, and hopelessness about prognosis. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is alarmingly common in ME/CFS and often occurs independent of depression, suggesting ME/CFS-specific suffering (energy limitations, loss of identity, medical gaslighting) drives suicide risk.

Methods: Analysis of survey data from CFS patients (n=1,508) assessing suicide risk factors including illness severity, diagnostic labels, comorbidities, social support, and healthcare experiences. Results: Key ME/CFS-specific risk factors: (1) Severe functional limitations (strongest predictor); (2) Use of "CFS" diagnostic label vs. "ME" (OR 2.81, associated with stigma); (3) Absence of comorbidities (OR 3.48, paradoxically increases risk, possibly due to lack of medical legitimacy); (4) Lack of social support; (5) Medical dismissal and gaslighting. Notably, traditional psychiatric risk factors explained less variance than illness-specific factors. Conclusions: Suicide risk in CFS is driven more by illness-specific suffering (functional loss, medical invalidation, hopelessness about prognosis) than by psychiatric comorbidity. Interventions should address these CFS-specific stressors.},

Patients with longer disease duration showed normalized cytokine levels. We identified a signature of 17 cytokines that distinguished early ME/CFS from controls.

Inflammatory markers including IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines were elevated before and after exercise testing. Hyperinflammatory responses were amplified notably in women over 45 years with diminished estradiol levels, suggesting sex hormone link to immune dysregulation. Impaired energy production involving citric acid cycle dysfunction, fatty acid oxidation defects, and disrupted amino acid metabolism worsened after exercise. Findings suggest potential treatments including estrogen supplements for inflammatory response in women.},

Immune system alterations in ME/CFS patients have been reported, including changes in inflammatory cytokines, natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and B and T cell phenotypes. Mast cells play a central role in allergic reactions and anaphylaxis; however they also contribute to acquired and innate immunity. Methods: We examined the surface expression of markers for activation (CD117, CD34), maturity (FcεRI, tryptase, chymase), and histamine release (CD63) on mast cells (MC) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 18 ME/CFS patients and 13 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results: We report a significant increase in the naïve MC population (CD117+CD34+FcεRI−chymase−) in both moderate and severe ME/CFS patients. There was also a significant increase in CD40 ligand and major histocompatibility complex II receptors on differentiated MC in severe ME/CFS patients. Conclusions: These data demonstrate abnormalities in MC phenotypes in ME/CFS, supporting the hypothesis that MC may be involved in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS.},

  abstract={Background: Anecdotal reports and uncontrolled trials have suggested therapeutic benefit of antihistamines in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Objective: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the therapeutic efficacy of the nonsedating antihistamine terfenadine in CFS. Methods: Thirty patients with CFS were enrolled. After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, subjects were randomly assigned to receive terfenadine (60 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. Primary outcome measures included symptom amelioration, and improvement in physical and social functioning and health perceptions. Results: Twenty-eight subjects completed the study. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on any outcome measure. Terfenadine was not superior to placebo in treating symptoms of CFS or in improving physical or social functioning or health perceptions. Conclusions: Terfenadine is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in treating CFS symptoms. The high prevalence of atopy (73\%) and positive immediate skin test results (53\%) in this CFS population warrants further investigation.},

  abstract={Long COVID patient meeting ME/CFS criteria treated with multimodal approach. H1 blockers (loratadine 10 mg OR fexofenadine 180 mg) and H2 blocker (famotidine 40 mg BID) reported as "helpful with energy and cognitive dysfunction." Stopping these medications resulted in "increased fatigue and increased cognitive dysfunction, both of which improved rapidly upon resumption." Cromolyn 400 mg QID associated with improvement in resting heart rate (fell from 130-140 bpm to 100-105 bpm). Quercetin 1000 mg BID showed "improvement in fatigue and allergic symptoms." Case demonstrates potential benefit of mast cell-targeted therapies in post-viral fatigue syndromes.},

  abstract={Mast cell activation shares pathogenic mechanisms with ME/CFS through excessive histamine, heparin, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and protease release. Spillover of vasoactive mediators into systemic circulation may worsen orthostatic intolerance via histamine's vascular effects. Beta-2-adrenergic receptor dysfunction amplifies symptoms. ME/CFS patients with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and orthostatic intolerance reported symptom alleviation significantly more often following mast cell-targeted treatment (p<0.0001). Study suggests vascular pathomechanisms and mast cell mediators may link ME/CFS with common comorbidities.},

  abstract={Quercetin (100 μM) was more effective than cromolyn in inhibiting mast cell mediator release. IgE/Anti-IgE stimulation: quercetin inhibited histamine (82\% vs 67\%), PGD2 (77\% vs 75\%), and leukotrienes (99\% vs 88\%) comparably to cromolyn. Substance P stimulation: quercetin dramatically outperformed cromolyn, reducing IL-8 from 437.2 to 115.4 pg/mL (quercetin) vs 362.9 pg/mL (cromolyn). Quercetin worked prophylactically (30 min pre-stimulus); cromolyn required simultaneous addition. Clinical trials: Contact dermatitis patients taking quercetin 2 g/day for 3 days showed >50\% reduction in nickel patch reactions in 8 of 10 patients; pruritus eliminated completely. Photosensitivity study: quercetin 1 g increased minimal erythema dose in all patients (p=0.002). Findings support quercetin as effective mast cell stabilizer, superior to cromolyn in vitro.},

  abstract={Amitriptyline (AMI) and prochlorperazine (PRO) at 25 μM significantly reduced IL-8, VEGF, and IL-6 release from stimulated human mast cells, unlike bupropion, citalopram, or atomoxetine. Mechanism involves modulation of intracellular calcium (demonstrated via FURA2 AM calcium indicator assays). AMI inhibits histamine release from stimulated mast cells while permitting serotonin release. The ability of amitriptyline, but not other antidepressants, to inhibit human mast cell release of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be relevant to their apparent benefit in CFS. Suggests specific pharmacological mechanism beyond general antidepressant effects.},

Conclusions: Ketotifen showed no benefit over placebo in fibromyalgia. Relevance to ME/CFS: Fibromyalgia involves central sensitization like ME/CFS; negative result suggests mast cell stabilization alone may not address core pathophysiology in central pain syndromes.},

Rupatadine demonstrated mast cell stabilizing effects in addition to H1 receptor antagonism and PAF antagonism. Mechanism involves direct inhibition of mast cell degranulation. More effective than levocetirizine and desloratadine at inhibiting PAF-induced mast cell mediator release. Suggests rupatadine may be particularly beneficial in allergic and inflammatory conditions involving mast cell activation.},
