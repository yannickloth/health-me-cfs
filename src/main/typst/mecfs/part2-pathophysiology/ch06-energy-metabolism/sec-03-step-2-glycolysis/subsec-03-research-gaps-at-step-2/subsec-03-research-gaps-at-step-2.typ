=== Research Gaps at Step 2


Three glycolytic-enzyme-level gaps remain open in ME/CFS: (G4) direct activity assay of hexokinase I/II, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in patient tissue; (G5) the mitochondrial-outer-membrane anchoring of hexokinase II, which normally couples glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation; and (G6) whether PFK1 allosteric regulation (AMP/ATP, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate) is dysfunctional in ME/CFS PBMCs or muscle. Prioritization uses the framework from @sec:step1-substrate-delivery.

G4 is the highest-priority Step 2 gap because it is the single measurement that would resolve whether the reduced basal glycolysis observed by Mandarano et al.\ in PBMCs  reflects enzyme-level lesions or upstream substrate limitation. No Step 2 gap is _individually essential_ to the chain; glycolysis is a rate-limiting pipeline with parallel isoforms, so partial failure produces graded capacity loss rather than shutdown.
