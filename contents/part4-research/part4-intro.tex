\part{Research and Evidence Synthesis}
\label{part:research}

This part provides comprehensive coverage of ME/CFS research, synthesizing findings from clinical trials, observational studies, and experimental research. For each major study, we provide:

\begin{itemize}
\item Study design and methodology
\item Key findings
\item Implications for understanding ME/CFS
\item Limitations and caveats
\item How findings connect to other research
\end{itemize}

This synthesis approach makes the scattered research literature more accessible and actionable.
