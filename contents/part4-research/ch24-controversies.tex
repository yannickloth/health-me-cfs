\section{The NIH ``Effort Preference'' Controversy (2024--2025)}
\label{sec:effort-preference-debate}

The 2024 NIH deep phenotyping study by Walitt et al.~\cite{walitt2024deep} generated one of the most significant controversies in recent ME/CFS research history. While the study documented multiple objective biological abnormalities (catecholamine deficiency, immune dysfunction, autonomic abnormalities), its interpretive framing around ``effort preference'' sparked intense criticism from patients, clinicians, and researchers.

\subsection{The Central Claim}

The study concluded that ``effort preference, not fatigue, is the defining motor behavior'' of post-infectious ME/CFS. The authors proposed that ME/CFS patients have altered ``effort preference''---defined as ``how much effort a person subjectively wants to exert''---due to dysfunction of integrative brain regions, particularly the temporoparietal junction (TPJ).

\subsection{Why the Framing Was Controversial}

\subsubsection{Language Echoing Psychogenic Models}
The term ``preference'' implies volition and choice. Critics argued this framing echoed decades of psychogenic characterizations of ME/CFS that attributed symptoms to patients' beliefs, behaviors, or psychological states rather than biological dysfunction. The language resonated uncomfortably with PACE trial rhetoric about ``unhelpful illness beliefs.''

\subsubsection{Methodological Problems with the EEfRT}
The Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) was designed to measure motivation for rewards in psychiatric conditions, with an explicit requirement that tasks be easy enough that fatigue does not confound results. In the Walitt study:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ME/CFS patients completed only 65\% of hard trials vs.\ 96--99\% for controls
    \item Seven of 15 patients performed below any control participant
    \item Physical function scores (SF-36) were 28.7 for patients vs.\ 97.5 for controls
\end{itemize}

Kirvin-Quamme et al.'s reanalysis~\cite{kirvinquamme2025effort} demonstrated a significant correlation between task completion ability and task choice, indicating the tool measured ability, not preference. Their conclusion: patients were ``unable,'' not ``unwilling.''

\subsubsection{Failure to Document PEM}
The study used single-day CPET rather than the gold-standard two-day protocol, failing to objectively document post-exertional malaise---the defining feature of ME/CFS. PEM was mentioned only three times in the entire paper.

\subsubsection{Selection Bias}
By excluding severely affected patients (25\% of the ME/CFS population), the study could not characterize the full spectrum of disease severity.

\subsection{Published Academic Responses}

\subsubsection{Nature Communications Commentary}
Davenport et al.\ published a formal critique in \textit{Nature Communications}~\cite{effortcritique2025} stating the interpretation ``risks reinforcing skepticism about the serious biological nature of [ME] and its hallmark of post-exertional malaise (PEM), as well as its potential misclassification as a mental health condition.''

\subsubsection{Authors' Reply}
Walitt et al.\ responded~\cite{walitt2025reply} clarifying that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deconditioning and ME/CFS are not mutually exclusive
    \item Deconditioning is a consequence, not cause
    \item Equal maximum grip strength argues against pure deconditioning
    \item Impaired performance occurs before oxidative metabolism stress
\end{itemize}

Critics noted the reply did not address the fundamental EEfRT methodology concerns or the harm of ``preference'' language.

\subsubsection{Frontiers in Psychology Reanalysis}
The Kirvin-Quamme et al.\ reanalysis~\cite{kirvinquamme2025effort} provided detailed statistical evidence that the EEfRT data supported inability rather than altered preference, calling for proper task calibration in future studies.

\subsection{NIH Clarification}

Following criticism, NIH clarified that ``preference'' referred to ``subconscious or unconscious or pre-conscious calculations by the brain'' rather than conscious choice. Patient advocates responded that if unconscious brain dysfunction was the intended meaning, using ``preference''---a word implying choice---was misleading and potentially harmful to patients.

\subsection{Clinical and Research Implications}

\subsubsection{Potential Harms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reinforcement of psychogenic misconceptions among clinicians unfamiliar with ME/CFS
    \item Justification for continued use of graded exercise therapy despite harms
    \item Barriers to disability recognition if symptoms are framed as ``preference''
    \item Psychological harm to patients from invalidating language
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lessons for Future Research}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assessment tools must be appropriate for the population studied
    \item Language matters: terminology should not inadvertently pathologize or blame patients
    \item Peer review should include ME/CFS experts and patient representatives
    \item Objective measures of PEM (two-day CPET) should be standard
    \item Study designs should include severely affected patients
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Separating Data from Interpretation}

Despite the interpretive controversy, the Walitt study's biological findings---CSF catecholamine deficiency, B cell population shifts, autonomic dysfunction, chronotropic incompetence---represent valuable contributions confirmed by other research. The challenge for the field is to build on these objective findings while rejecting framings that risk harm to patients.

\begin{observation}[The Value of Controversial Studies]
The NIH deep phenotyping study illustrates how a study can simultaneously advance biological understanding and generate harmful interpretations. The catecholamine findings alone---the first CSF neurotransmitter measurements in ME/CFS---provide crucial mechanistic insight. Future citations should specify which findings are being referenced (the objective biological data vs.\ the contested ``effort preference'' interpretation) to prevent misuse while preserving scientific value.
\end{observation}

\section{Clinical Utility for Respiratory and Allergy Medicine}
\label{sec:clinical-utility-specialists}

ME/CFS research has generated diagnostic and therapeutic insights with broader applicability to respiratory and allergy medicine, suggesting that pneumologists and allergologists are well-positioned to contribute to both ME/CFS research and management of related conditions in general practice.

\subsection{Transferable Diagnostic Techniques}

\subsubsection{Two-Day Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing}

The two-day CPET protocol, which objectively quantifies post-exertional malaise through measurement of performance decline between testing days~\cite{Lim2020}, has utility beyond ME/CFS diagnosis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Distinguishing deconditioning from pathology}: In disability evaluations, malingering concerns, or contested diagnoses, day-2 performance decline provides objective biomarker
    \item \textbf{Post-viral assessment}: Identifying which respiratory infection survivors require specialized chronic illness management vs.\ standard recovery
    \item \textbf{Exercise prescription safety}: Determining whether exercise rehabilitation is appropriate or contraindicated
\end{itemize}

The meta-analysis by Lim et al.\ demonstrated significant workload decline at ventilatory threshold in ME/CFS patients (-14.6W) while controls showed improvement (+6.5W, p=0.01), providing reproducible objective measurement.

\subsubsection{Capnography in Orthostatic Assessment}

Standard vital sign monitoring misses orthostatic hypocapnia, present in 20.6\% of ME/CFS patients vs.\ 2.9\% of controls~\cite{Natelson2022}. Integration of capnography during tilt-table testing or simple lean tests can identify:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Breathing pattern disorders causing ``unexplained'' dizziness or brain fog
    \item Hypocapnic cerebral hypoperfusion (25\% drop in CO2, 50\% drop in brain blood flow)
    \item Patients whose orthostatic symptoms will respond to breathing retraining rather than pharmacologic intervention
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Gas Exchange Analysis During Exercise}

ME/CFS research has clarified that severe dyspnea can occur despite normal pulmonary function tests, with the primary pathology involving peripheral oxygen extraction at the skeletal muscle level rather than central cardiopulmonary dysfunction~\cite{Joseph2023}. This insight prevents unnecessary invasive testing and redirects clinical investigation toward appropriate mechanisms.

\subsection{Underdiagnosed Comorbidities in Allergy Practice}

\subsubsection{Mast Cell Activation Syndrome}

MCAS develops in approximately 25\% of ME/CFS patients over the disease course~\cite{Wirth2023}, but prevalence in general allergy practice populations remains understudied. The condition is likely underdiagnosed due to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-specific symptoms overlapping with common allergic conditions
    \item Lack of widely available, validated diagnostic criteria
    \item Episodic nature making timing of testing challenging
\end{itemize}

Simple therapeutic trials with H1/H2 antihistamine combinations (e.g., loratadine + famotidine) show 72\% response rates in Long COVID/ME/CFS populations, suggesting empiric trials may be both diagnostic and therapeutic for patients with treatment-resistant ``allergic'' symptoms.

\subsubsection{Histamine Intolerance}

While affecting only 1--3\% of the general population, histamine intolerance appears markedly more prevalent in ME/CFS, Long COVID, and fibromyalgia. Recognition of this pattern may identify an underserved patient subgroup in allergy practices.

\subsection{Post-Viral Respiratory Syndrome Recognition}

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that 51\% of Long COVID patients meeting PEM criteria satisfied ME/CFS diagnostic criteria~\cite{Komaroff2023}, establishing ME/CFS as a common outcome of post-viral syndromes following respiratory infections. This pattern extends beyond SARS-CoV-2:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 40.3\% of SARS-CoV-1 survivors developed unexplained chronic fatigue
    \item 27\% of SARS-CoV-1 survivors fulfilled CFS diagnostic criteria
    \item Post-influenza, post-pneumonia, and post-mononucleosis chronic fatigue syndromes share overlapping features
\end{itemize}

Pneumologists treating respiratory infection survivors are positioned to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify early who is at risk for chronic sequelae
    \item Implement preventive rest protocols during acute illness
    \item Recognize when referral to ME/CFS specialists is appropriate
    \item Apply two-day CPET for objective documentation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Opportunities}

Areas where respiratory and allergy medicine expertise could advance ME/CFS understanding:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ventilation-perfusion mismatch mechanisms}: Indirect evidence exists from elevated VE/VCO2 ratios; direct V/Q scanning studies are lacking
    \item \textbf{Respiratory muscle function}: Objective diaphragm function assessment in patients reporting respiratory muscle fatigue
    \item \textbf{MCAS prevalence in general populations}: Establishing baseline rates in allergy practice for comparison to ME/CFS cohorts
    \item \textbf{Breathing pattern disorder interventions}: Capnometry-guided retraining protocols adapted for ME/CFS energy limitations
\end{itemize}

\begin{achievement}[Immunomodulatory Therapeutic Approaches]
Low-dose naltrexone (LDN), originally investigated for immune modulation, shows 73.9\% positive response rates in ME/CFS~\cite{Cabanas2021} through restoration of TRPM3 ion channel function in natural killer cells. This mechanism-based approach exemplifies how immunologic expertise translates to novel ME/CFS therapeutics.
