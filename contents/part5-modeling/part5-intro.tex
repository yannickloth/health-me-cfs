\part{Mathematical and Computational Modeling}
\label{part:modeling}

This part presents mathematical and computational models of ME/CFS pathophysiology, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Biochemical process models}: Detailed mathematical descriptions of energy metabolism, immune function, and other key processes
\item \textbf{Temporal evolution models}: How symptoms develop and progress over time
\item \textbf{Response to stimuli}: Mathematical modeling of how the body responds to exertion, infections, treatments, and other inputs
\item \textbf{Multi-system integration}: Models connecting different physiological systems
\item \textbf{Predictive models}: Simulating disease trajectories and treatment responses
\end{itemize}

These models synthesize biological understanding into quantitative frameworks that can generate testable predictions and guide therapeutic strategies.
