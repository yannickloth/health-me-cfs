\chapter{Core Symptoms}
\label{ch:core-symptoms}

ME/CFS is characterized by several hallmark symptoms that must be present for diagnosis across most diagnostic frameworks. This chapter provides detailed descriptions of each core symptom.

\section{Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)}
\label{sec:pem}

Post-exertional malaise (PEM), also termed post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE) or post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion (PENE), is considered the hallmark feature of ME/CFS.

\subsection{Definition and Characteristics}
% Detailed description of PEM
% Triggers (physical, cognitive, emotional exertion)
% Time course (delay, duration, recovery)
% Severity spectrum

\subsection{Physiological Basis}
% What happens during PEM at the cellular level
% Metabolic changes
% Immune system activation
% Neurological changes

\subsection{Measurement and Assessment}
% Clinical assessment tools
% Objective measures (e.g., CPET findings)
% Patient-reported outcome measures

\section{Unrefreshing Sleep}
\label{sec:sleep}

\subsection{Sleep Dysfunction Patterns}
% Types of sleep problems in ME/CFS
% Polysomnography findings
% Sleep architecture abnormalities

\subsection{Related Sleep Disorders}
% Overlap with sleep apnea, RLS, etc.
% Differential diagnosis

\section{Cognitive Impairment}
\label{sec:cognitive}

Cognitive dysfunction, often described as ``brain fog,'' is a prominent and disabling feature of ME/CFS.

\subsection{Domains of Cognitive Dysfunction}
% Attention and concentration
% Memory (working, short-term, long-term)
% Processing speed
% Executive function
% Language and word-finding

\subsection{Neuropsychological Testing}
% Objective cognitive assessments
% Pattern of deficits
% Comparison to subjective reports

\subsection{Neuroimaging Findings}
% fMRI studies
% PET scan findings
% Structural MRI observations

\section{Autonomic Dysfunction}
\label{sec:autonomic}

\subsection{Orthostatic Intolerance}
% Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
% Orthostatic hypotension
% Neurally mediated hypotension
% Tilt table testing

\subsection{Other Autonomic Symptoms}
% Temperature dysregulation
% Sweating abnormalities
% Gastrointestinal symptoms
% Urinary dysfunction
% Cardiac symptoms

\section{Pain}
\label{sec:pain}

\subsection{Types of Pain in ME/CFS}
% Myalgia (muscle pain)
% Arthralgia (joint pain)
% Headaches
% Neuropathic pain

\subsection{Pain Mechanisms}
% Central sensitization
% Peripheral mechanisms
% Neuroinflammation
