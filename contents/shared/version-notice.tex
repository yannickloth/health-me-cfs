\begin{achievement*}[Living Document]
This is an actively maintained, regularly updated document. The research landscape for ME/CFS is evolving rapidly, and this documentation is continuously expanded and refined to reflect new findings, improved analysis, and emerging therapeutic approaches.

\textbf{To ensure you have the most current version:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Visit the Zenodo repository: \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18370021}
\item Check the publication date: This version was compiled on \textbf{\today}
\item Bookmark the DOI link above and check periodically for updates
\item Significant updates typically occur monthly as new research emerges and analysis deepens
\end{itemize}

Using an outdated version may mean missing critical research findings, treatment protocol refinements, or corrections to earlier content. The difference between versions can be substantial, particularly in rapidly evolving areas such as biomarker research, immune dysfunction mechanisms, and emerging therapies.

\textbf{Version control:} All versions are permanently archived on Zenodo with full change documentation. You can compare versions to identify what has been updated since your last reading.
