\part{Pathophysiology and Biological Mechanisms}
\label{part:pathophysiology}

This part explores the biological underpinnings of ME/CFS, from well-established phenomena to emerging theories. We examine:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Known phenomena}: Mechanisms with strong research support
\item \textbf{Suspected phenomena}: Plausible mechanisms with preliminary evidence
\item \textbf{Related phenomena}: Connections to other conditions (allergies, autoimmune diseases, etc.)
\item \textbf{Biochemical processes}: Detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms
\end{itemize}

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted treatments and explaining the diverse symptomatology of ME/CFS.
