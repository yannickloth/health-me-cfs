\section{Selective Energy Dysfunction Hypothesis}
\label{sec:selective-dysfunction}

\begin{open_question}[Why Does Hair Grow Normally in Severe ME/CFS?]
A patient with severe ME/CFS cannot walk to the bathroom, cannot sustain a conversation, cannot tolerate light or sound---yet their hair continues to grow at a normal rate. Their nails grow. Wounds heal. These observations pose a fundamental challenge to the ``global energy failure'' model of ME/CFS: if mitochondrial dysfunction were truly systemic, \emph{all} energy-dependent processes should be impaired proportionally.

This chapter proposes that ME/CFS represents \emph{selective} rather than global energy dysfunction---specifically, a CNS coordination failure that impairs demand-responsive, CNS-dependent processes while sparing autonomous local processes that operate independently of central regulation.
\end{open_question}

\subsection{Motivation and Clinical Observations}

The selective dysfunction hypothesis emerged from a simple observation: processes that require CNS coordination and scale with demand are severely impaired in ME/CFS, while processes that operate autonomously at the local tissue level remain intact.

\begin{keypoint}[Preserved vs. Impaired Processes]
\textbf{Preserved} (minimal CNS dependency):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hair growth---local follicle autonomous cycle
    \item Nail growth---keratinocyte autonomous proliferation
    \item Basic wound healing---local inflammatory cascade
    \item Baseline digestion---enteric nervous system (``second brain'')
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Severely impaired} (high CNS dependency):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exercise capacity---requires CNS motor coordination + autonomic scaling
    \item Cognitive function---intrinsically CNS-dependent
    \item Orthostatic regulation---requires real-time CNS autonomic control
    \item Temperature regulation---hypothalamic coordination
    \item Sleep architecture---brainstem and cortical orchestration
\end{itemize}
\end{keypoint}

This pattern suggests that ME/CFS pathophysiology may preferentially affect the CNS's ability to coordinate systemic responses, rather than causing uniform cellular energy failure throughout the body.


\subsection{Formal Framework}

We formalize the selective dysfunction hypothesis using three quantitative definitions that enable testable predictions.

\begin{definition}[CNS-Dependency Index]
\label{def:cns-dependency}
For any biological process $P$, define the \textbf{CNS-dependency index} $\delta_{CNS}(P) \in [0,1]$ as:
\[
\delta_{CNS}(P) = \frac{N_{CNS}(P)}{N_{total}(P)}
\]
where $N_{CNS}(P)$ is the number of regulatory signals requiring CNS coordination and $N_{total}(P)$ is the total number of regulatory signals controlling process $P$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\delta_{CNS} = 0$: Fully autonomous (no CNS involvement)
    \item $\delta_{CNS} = 1$: Fully CNS-dependent (all regulation via CNS)
    \item $\delta_{CNS} \in (0,1)$: Mixed regulation
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Demand-Responsiveness Index]
\label{def:demand-responsiveness}
For process $P$, define the \textbf{demand-responsiveness index} $\rho(P) \in [0, \infty)$ as:
\[
\rho(P) = \frac{\max_{\text{challenge}} \text{Output}(P) - \text{Output}_{\text{baseline}}(P)}{\text{Output}_{\text{baseline}}(P)}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho = 0$: Constant output (no demand scaling)
    \item $\rho > 0$: Output increases under challenge
    \item $\rho > 1$: Output can more than double under maximal demand
\end{itemize}

For standardization to $[0,1]$, we use $\tilde{\rho}(P) = \frac{\rho(P)}{1 + \rho(P)}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Selective Dysfunction Severity]
\label{def:dysfunction-severity}
The \textbf{predicted dysfunction severity} for process $P$ in ME/CFS is:
\[
S(P) = \alpha \cdot \delta_{CNS}(P) + \beta \cdot \tilde{\rho}(P) + \gamma \cdot \delta_{CNS}(P) \cdot \tilde{\rho}(P)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha > 0$: Weight for CNS-dependency (main effect)
    \item $\beta > 0$: Weight for demand-responsiveness (main effect)
    \item $\gamma > 0$: Weight for interaction (synergistic vulnerability)
\end{itemize}

The interaction term $\gamma \cdot \delta_{CNS} \cdot \tilde{\rho}$ captures synergistic vulnerability: processes that are \emph{both} CNS-dependent \emph{and} demand-responsive are predicted to be most severely affected.
\end{definition}

\begin{hypothesis}[Selective Dysfunction Hypothesis]
\label{hyp:selective-dysfunction}
In ME/CFS, dysfunction severity $S_{observed}(P)$ correlates strongly with predicted severity $S(P)$:
\[
S_{observed}(P) = S(P) + \epsilon
\]
where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed error with mean zero.

\textbf{Testable prediction:} Spearman correlation $\rho_s$ between $S(P)$ and $S_{observed}(P)$ across processes should satisfy $\rho_s > 0.7$ (strong positive correlation).

\textbf{Falsification criterion:} If $\rho_s < 0.3$, the hypothesis is refuted.

\textbf{Certainty:} 0.55 (moderate evidence from clinical observations, formal testing required)
\end{hypothesis}


\subsection{Evidence Taxonomy}

Table~\ref{tab:process-classification} classifies biological processes by their predicted and observed dysfunction status.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\caption{Process classification by CNS-dependency and demand-responsiveness with predicted and observed dysfunction in ME/CFS.}
\label{tab:process-classification}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Process} & $\delta_{CNS}$ & $\tilde{\rho}$ & \textbf{Predicted $S$} & \textbf{Observed} & \textbf{Certainty} \\
\midrule
\multicolumn{6}{l}{\textit{Preserved processes (low $\delta_{CNS}$, low $\rho$)}} \\
Hair growth & 0.1 & 0.0 & 0.05 & Preserved & 0.7 \\

\end{tabular}

\footnotesize
\textbf{Notes:} $S$ calculated with $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 0.3$, $\gamma = 0.2$. Certainty reflects confidence in classification based on literature review.
\end{table}

\begin{observation}[Demand-Response Failure Pattern]
\label{obs:demand-response}
ME/CFS patients consistently show \emph{preserved baseline function} with \emph{impaired challenge response}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Orthostatic challenge: 91--100\% show abnormal CBF reduction during tilt-table testing, with 3-fold greater reduction than controls~\cite{Novak2022}
    \item Exercise challenge: 2-day CPET reveals decline on day 2 (vs. improvement in controls)
    \item Cognitive challenge: Fatigue elevated 24--48h post-cognitive task
\end{itemize}

This pattern is diagnostic: baseline function is maintained, but the system cannot scale to meet increased demand. This is precisely what the selective dysfunction model predicts for high-$\rho$ processes.
\end{observation}


\subsection{Causal Structure}

Figure~\ref{fig:selective-dysfunction-dag} presents the causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) for selective dysfunction. The key structural feature is the \emph{absence} of causal paths from the CNS energy crisis node to preserved autonomous processes.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{figures/fig-selective-dysfunction-dag.tex}
\end{figure}

The DAG encodes the following causal claims with certainty-weighted edges:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Triggers $\rightarrow$ CNS Energy Crisis} (certainty: 0.65--0.70): Viral infection, immune dysregulation, or severe stress initiates CNS energy deficit
    \item \textbf{CNS Crisis $\rightarrow$ Cognitive Dysfunction} (certainty: 0.85): Direct effect of brain hypometabolism
    \item \textbf{CNS Crisis $\rightarrow$ Autonomic Control Failure} (certainty: 0.80): Impaired CNS signaling disrupts autonomic regulation
    \item \textbf{Autonomic Failure $\rightarrow$ Orthostatic Intolerance} (certainty: 0.75): Secondary to failed cardiovascular coordination
    \item \textbf{No edge: CNS $\rightarrow$ Autonomous Processes}: Hair, nails, wound healing operate independently
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Mechanistic Sub-Hypotheses}

Five mechanistic hypotheses explain \emph{why} CNS might be selectively vulnerable.

\subsubsection{Astrocyte Energy Gate Hypothesis}

The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) provides 30--50\% of neuronal ATP~\cite{Pellerin1994,Magistretti2018}. Unlike peripheral tissues with direct glucose access, neurons depend on astrocytes to convert glucose to lactate and shuttle it via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT2/MCT4).

\begin{hypothesis}[Astrocyte Energy Gate]
\label{hyp:astrocyte-gate}
Dysfunction in the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle causes CNS-specific energy failure while peripheral tissues (with direct glucose access) remain unaffected.

\textbf{Mechanism:}
\begin{align}
L_n &= k_{MCT} \cdot [L_a] \cdot f(\text{transporter integrity}) \\
E_n &= g(L_n, \text{mitochondrial function})
\end{align}
where $L_n$ = neuronal lactate uptake, $L_a$ = astrocyte lactate concentration, $k_{MCT}$ = MCT transporter efficiency, $E_n$ = neuronal ATP production.

\textbf{ME/CFS hypothesis:} Reduced $k_{MCT}$ or impaired $f(\cdot)$ $\Rightarrow$ $L_n \downarrow$ despite normal $L_a$ $\Rightarrow$ CNS-specific energy deficit.

\textbf{Certainty:} 0.4 (plausible mechanism from neuroscience; no direct ME/CFS evidence)
\end{hypothesis}

Figure~\ref{fig:astrocyte-lactate-shuttle} illustrates the ANLS mechanism and proposed dysfunction site.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{figures/fig-astrocyte-lactate-shuttle.tex}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{CNS Energy Triage Hypothesis}

Under energy scarcity, the CNS may implement a hardwired priority hierarchy that preserves vital functions at the expense of ``luxury'' cognitive processes.

\begin{hypothesis}[CNS Energy Triage]
\label{hyp:energy-triage}
The CNS implements a priority-based energy allocation system under scarcity:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Tier 1} (never sacrificed): Brainstem vital functions --- $E_{min} = 0.30 \cdot E_{total}$
    \item \textbf{Tier 2}: Sensory processing --- $E_{threshold} = 0.50 \cdot E_{total}$
    \item \textbf{Tier 3}: Motor coordination --- $E_{threshold} = 0.60 \cdot E_{total}$
    \item \textbf{Tier 4}: Memory consolidation --- $E_{threshold} = 0.70 \cdot E_{total}$
    \item \textbf{Tier 5}: Executive function --- $E_{threshold} = 0.85 \cdot E_{total}$
    \item \textbf{Tier 6} (first sacrificed): Complex cognition --- $E_{threshold} = 0.95 \cdot E_{total}$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Prediction:} Cognitive symptoms should follow the inverse hierarchy. Complex cognition fails first; vital functions never fail.

\textbf{Clinical correlation:} ``Brain fog'' (executive dysfunction, Tier 5--6) is among the earliest and most prominent symptoms, consistent with these tiers being sacrificed first.

\textbf{Certainty:} 0.5 (consistent with observed symptom hierarchy; formal testing needed)
\end{hypothesis}

Figure~\ref{fig:energy-triage-hierarchy} visualizes the triage hierarchy with the typical ME/CFS energy threshold.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{figures/fig-energy-triage-hierarchy.tex}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Blood-Brain Barrier Vulnerability Hypothesis}

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) creates a unique vulnerability: damage signals may accumulate in the CNS while peripheral clearance continues normally.

\begin{hypothesis}[BBB Compartmentalization]
\label{hyp:bbb-vulnerability}
The BBB traps mitochondrial damage markers and limits cofactor delivery, causing CNS-specific accumulation of dysfunction.

\textbf{Steady-state model:}
\[
\frac{[M]_{CSF}}{[M]_{blood}} = \frac{R_{production}}{P_{BBB} \cdot k_{clear}}
\]
where $[M]$ = damage marker concentration, $R_{production}$ = production rate, $P_{BBB}$ = BBB permeability, $k_{clear}$ = clearance rate.

\textbf{ME/CFS prediction:} If $P_{BBB}$ is reduced or $R_{production}$ elevated, the CSF/blood ratio increases, indicating CNS-specific accumulation.

\textbf{Testable:} Measure mtDNA, 8-OHdG, or other damage markers in paired CSF and blood samples. Elevated CSF/blood ratio supports hypothesis.

\textbf{Certainty:} 0.45 (BBB dysfunction documented in neuroinflammation; ME/CFS-specific data limited)
\end{hypothesis}


\subsubsection{Sickness Behavior Persistence Hypothesis}

Evolutionary sickness behavior programs target \emph{behavioral outputs} (requiring CNS) while sparing truly autonomous processes.

\begin{hypothesis}[Sickness Behavior Stuck On]
\label{hyp:sickness-behavior}
ME/CFS represents a sickness behavior program that fails to disengage, chronically suppressing CNS-mediated behavioral outputs while leaving autonomous local processes unaffected.

\textbf{Activation function:}
\[
\text{SB}(t) = \sigma\left(\sum_{i} w_i \cdot [\text{cytokine}_i](t) - \theta\right)
\]
where $\sigma$ is sigmoid activation, $w_i$ are cytokine weights, and $\theta$ is the activation threshold.

\textbf{Normal state:} Acute infection elevates cytokines $\Rightarrow$ SB activates $\Rightarrow$ infection resolves $\Rightarrow$ cytokines normalize $\Rightarrow$ SB deactivates.

\textbf{ME/CFS state:} Chronic low-grade immune activation maintains $\sum w_i \cdot [\text{cytokine}_i] > \theta$ indefinitely $\Rightarrow$ SB persists.

\textbf{Evolutionary logic:} Sickness behavior evolved to suppress \emph{behavioral} energy expenditure during infection. Hair growth has no behavioral component and was never targeted by this program.

\textbf{Certainty:} 0.55 (strong evolutionary logic; moderate mechanistic support from neuroimaging~\cite{Nakatomi2014neuroinflammation})
\end{hypothesis}


\subsubsection{Partial Torpor Trap Hypothesis}

ME/CFS may represent incomplete engagement of torpor-like metabolic suppression mechanisms.

\begin{hypothesis}[Partial Torpor Trap]
\label{hyp:torpor}
ME/CFS involves partial engagement of torpor/hibernation pathways with failed arousal, trapping patients in a low-metabolic state.

\textbf{Torpor engagement dynamics:}
\[
\frac{d(\text{MR})}{dt} = -\alpha \cdot T_{signal} + \beta \cdot A_{signal}
\]
where MR = metabolic rate, $T_{signal}$ = torpor induction signal, $A_{signal}$ = arousal signal.

\textbf{Normal torpor:} $\alpha \cdot T > \beta \cdot A$ during entry; $\beta \cdot A > \alpha \cdot T$ during arousal.

\textbf{ME/CFS state:} $\alpha \cdot T > \beta \cdot A$ chronically (trapped in partial suppression).

\textbf{Testable markers:} Torpor-associated molecules (H$_2$S, adenosine, orexin) may be dysregulated.

\textbf{Certainty:} 0.35 (speculative; inspired by emerging torpor biology research)
\end{hypothesis}


\subsection{Testable Predictions}

The selective dysfunction hypothesis generates specific, falsifiable predictions.

\begin{prediction}[Hair Follicle Mitochondrial Function]
\label{pred:hair-follicle}
\textbf{Hypothesis:} Hair follicle mitochondria are functionally normal in ME/CFS patients.

\textbf{Measurement:} Mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption rate, OCR) in plucked hair follicle cells.

\textbf{Statistical design:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Test type: Equivalence test (TOST procedure)
    \item Equivalence margin: $\delta = 0.2 \times \bar{x}_{control}$ (20\% of control mean)
    \item Sample size: $n = 40$ per group (power = 0.8, $\alpha = 0.05$)
    \item Outcome: ME/CFS OCR equivalent to control OCR
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If confirmed: Strong support for selective (not global) mitochondrial dysfunction
    \item If refuted (ME/CFS OCR significantly lower): Global dysfunction model supported
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Feasibility:} Hair follicle collection is minimally invasive; mitochondrial respiration assays are established.
\end{prediction}

\begin{prediction}[CSF-to-Blood Lactate Gradient]
\label{pred:csf-lactate}
\textbf{Hypothesis:} CSF lactate is elevated relative to blood lactate in ME/CFS, indicating impaired lactate shuttling in CNS.

\textbf{Measurement:} Paired CSF and blood lactate concentrations.

\textbf{Statistical design:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Test type: Two-sample $t$-test on ratio $[L]_{CSF}/[L]_{blood}$
    \item Expected effect size: Cohen's $d \geq 0.5$ (medium effect)
    \item Sample size: $n = 64$ per group (power = 0.8, $\alpha = 0.05$)
    \item Outcome: Ratio elevated in ME/CFS vs. controls
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If confirmed: Supports astrocyte energy gate hypothesis
    \item If refuted: Lactate shuttle not primary mechanism
\end{itemize}
\end{prediction}

\begin{prediction}[Peripheral ATP During PEM]
\label{pred:peripheral-atp}
\textbf{Hypothesis:} Peripheral muscle ATP is preserved during PEM crashes (dysfunction is coordination failure, not local energy deficit).

\textbf{Measurement:} $^{31}$P-MRS of skeletal muscle during provoked PEM.

\textbf{Statistical design:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Test type: Repeated measures ANOVA (baseline vs. PEM)
    \item Expected: No significant decline in muscle ATP during PEM
    \item Comparison: CNS metabolic markers (via PET/MRS) should decline while peripheral markers remain stable
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If confirmed: Dysfunction is CNS coordination failure, not peripheral energy deficit
    \item If refuted (peripheral ATP drops): Global depletion model supported
\end{itemize}
\end{prediction}

\begin{prediction}[Direct Stimulation vs. Voluntary Contraction]
\label{pred:direct-stim}
\textbf{Hypothesis:} Direct electrical stimulation of muscles produces greater force than voluntary contraction in ME/CFS patients.

\textbf{Rationale:} If dysfunction is CNS coordination failure, bypassing CNS via direct stimulation should restore output.

\textbf{Measurement:} Compare force production: voluntary maximal contraction vs. electrical stimulation.

\textbf{Expected:} $F_{electrical} / F_{voluntary} > 1$ in ME/CFS (vs. ratio $\approx 1$ in controls).

\textbf{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If confirmed: Peripheral muscle capable; CNS drive impaired
    \item If refuted: Peripheral muscle intrinsically impaired
\end{itemize}
\end{prediction}

\begin{prediction}[Cognitive Triage Hierarchy]
\label{pred:cognitive-hierarchy}
\textbf{Hypothesis:} Cognitive impairment in ME/CFS follows the inverse of the energy triage hierarchy.

\textbf{Measurement:} Cognitive battery assessing each tier:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tier 6 (complex cognition): Abstract reasoning, creativity
    \item Tier 5 (executive function): Planning, multitasking, attention
    \item Tier 4 (memory): Working memory, recall
    \item Tier 3 (motor coordination): Fine motor, reaction time
    \item Tier 2 (sensory processing): Basic perception
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected:} Impairment severity: Tier 6 > Tier 5 > Tier 4 > Tier 3 > Tier 2.

\textbf{Statistical test:} Ordinal regression testing hierarchy effect.
\end{prediction}


\subsection{Subtype Classification Model}

The selective dysfunction framework suggests natural subtypes based on primary compartment affected.

\begin{hypothesis}[Selective Dysfunction Subtypes]
\label{hyp:subtypes}
ME/CFS can be classified into subtypes based on which compartment shows primary dysfunction:

\textbf{Input features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_1$: CSF catecholamine deficit (z-score)
    \item $x_2$: Orthostatic CBF reduction (\%)
    \item $x_3$: Muscle ATP deficit at rest (\%)
    \item $x_4$: Neuroimaging abnormality score (composite)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Classification rules:}
\begin{align*}
\text{Subtype A (CNS-Primary)} &: x_1 < -1.5 \land x_4 > 2 \land x_3 > -0.5 \\
\text{Subtype B (Autonomic-Primary)} &: x_2 > 30\% \land x_1 > -1.0 \\
\text{Subtype C (Peripheral-Primary)} &: x_3 < -1.5 \land x_1 > -1.0 \land x_4 < 1 \\
\text{Subtype D (Global/Advanced)} &: \text{Multiple criteria met}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Validation required:} Unsupervised clustering on biomarker panel; sensitivity/specificity analysis.

\textbf{Treatment implications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Subtype A: CNS-penetrant compounds, intranasal delivery
    \item Subtype B: Autonomic modulators (midodrine, pyridostigmine)
    \item Subtype C: Mitochondrial support, muscle-targeted interventions
    \item Subtype D: Multi-system approach
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Certainty:} 0.4 (framework plausible; requires validation cohort)
\end{hypothesis}


\subsection{Treatment Implications}

The selective dysfunction hypothesis has immediate treatment implications.

\subsubsection{Pharmacological Bypass Evidence}

\begin{observation}[Midodrine Effectiveness]
\label{obs:midodrine}
Midodrine (direct $\alpha_1$-adrenergic agonist) improves orthostatic symptoms in ME/CFS patients by directly stimulating peripheral vasculature, bypassing CNS autonomic coordination.

\textbf{Implication:} If peripheral targets were intrinsically dysfunctional, pharmacological bypass would not restore function. Midodrine effectiveness proves the peripheral machinery is intact; only CNS coordination is impaired.

This is strong evidence for the selective dysfunction model: the problem is signaling/coordination, not end-organ failure.
\end{observation}

\subsubsection{Therapeutic Strategy}

\begin{keypoint}[Treatment Strategy from Selective Dysfunction Model]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{CNS-targeted delivery}: Intranasal or intrathecal routes may outperform oral for CNS-targeted compounds
    \item \textbf{Pharmacological bypass}: Direct-acting agents that bypass CNS coordination (midodrine, direct muscle stimulation)
    \item \textbf{Reduce CNS energy demands}: Pacing as CNS energy management, not just ``activity reduction''
    \item \textbf{Subtype-specific targeting}: Match intervention to primary dysfunction compartment
\end{enumerate}
\end{keypoint}


\subsection{Compartmental Energy Model}

Figure~\ref{fig:compartmental-energy-model} presents the four-compartment energy model with CNS as the coordination bottleneck.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{figures/fig-compartmental-energy-model.tex}
\end{figure}

\begin{keypoint}[Model Interpretation]
The CNS compartment serves dual roles:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Primary dysfunction site}: Brain hypometabolism, catecholamine deficiency
    \item \textbf{Coordination bottleneck}: Secondary failures in autonomic and peripheral compartments result from impaired CNS signaling, not local energy deficits
\end{enumerate}

Autonomous processes bypass the CNS entirely and remain functional. This explains why:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hair grows normally (no CNS coordination required)
    \item Midodrine works (bypasses CNS, directly stimulates periphery)
    \item PEM affects demand-responsive but not baseline functions
\end{itemize}
\end{keypoint}


\subsection{Integration with Existing Hypotheses}

The selective dysfunction hypothesis integrates with and extends existing models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metabolic Safe Mode} (Section~\ref{sec:safe-mode}): Selective dysfunction specifies \emph{which} systems the safe mode affects (CNS-dependent, demand-responsive) and \emph{which} it spares (autonomous)

    \item \textbf{Glymphatic Clearance Failure} (Section~\ref{sec:glymphatic}): Provides mechanism for CNS-specific waste accumulation within the BBB vulnerability sub-hypothesis

    \item \textbf{Autonomic Dysfunction} (Chapter~\ref{ch:cardiovascular}): Reframes as CNS coordination failure rather than peripheral autonomic pathology

    \item \textbf{Mitochondrial Dysfunction} (Chapter~\ref{ch:energy-metabolism}): Constrains location---mitochondrial dysfunction may be CNS-specific or CNS-predominant rather than global
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Limitations and Uncertainties}

\begin{warning}[Limitations]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parameter estimation}: The $\delta_{CNS}$ and $\rho$ values in Table~\ref{tab:process-classification} are estimated, not empirically derived
    \item \textbf{Interaction complexity}: The additive model with interaction may oversimplify nonlinear relationships
    \item \textbf{Heterogeneity}: ME/CFS likely includes multiple pathophysiological subtypes; not all may fit this model
    \item \textbf{Causal direction}: The DAG assumes CNS dysfunction causes peripheral symptoms; reverse or bidirectional causation possible
    \item \textbf{Evidence gaps}: Direct tests of the hypothesis (hair follicle mitochondria, CSF lactate gradients) have not been performed
\end{enumerate}
\end{warning}


\subsection{Summary}

\begin{conclusion}
The selective energy dysfunction hypothesis proposes that ME/CFS preferentially affects CNS-dependent, demand-responsive biological processes while sparing autonomous local processes. This explains the paradox of preserved hair growth alongside severe functional impairment.

\textbf{Key features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formal quantification via CNS-dependency ($\delta_{CNS}$) and demand-responsiveness ($\rho$) indices
    \item Causal DAG with certainty-weighted edges
    \item Five mechanistic sub-hypotheses (astrocyte gate, energy triage, BBB vulnerability, sickness behavior, torpor trap)
    \item Specific, falsifiable predictions with statistical designs
    \item Natural subtype classification based on primary dysfunction compartment
    \item Treatment implications including pharmacological bypass and CNS-targeted delivery
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Overall certainty:} 0.55 (moderate)---hypothesis is consistent with clinical observations and supported by converging evidence from brain metabolism, autonomic dysfunction, and preserved autonomous function literature. Formal testing of predictions required.
\end{conclusion}
