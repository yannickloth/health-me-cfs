## Executive Summary

This study proposes a comprehensive multi-modal investigation of the Selective Energy Dysfunction Hypothesis in ME/CFS. The hypothesis posits that ME/CFS involves selective impairment of CNS-dependent and demand-responsive processes while autonomous peripheral processes remain preserved, suggesting brain energy dysfunction as the primary pathophysiological bottleneck.

Using a combination of neuroimaging (FDG-PET), exercise physiology (2-day CPET with muscle biopsies), autonomic challenge testing, neuromuscular testing, and novel peripheral tissue assessments, we will test five core predictions that differentiate this mechanism from global energy failure models.

**Innovation:** This is the first study to systematically test the selectivity pattern across CNS-dependent vs autonomous processes, using hair/nail growth as novel biomarkers of preserved peripheral function alongside established measures of impaired CNS coordination.

**Impact:** If validated, this framework would fundamentally reorient ME/CFS research toward CNS energy metabolism and provide mechanistic rationale for brain-targeted interventions, pacing strategies, and personalized subtyping.

## Study Design Summary

**Sample:** n=72 total (36 ME/CFS + 36 matched controls)
**Duration:** 3 years (Year 1 pilot, Years 2-3 main collection)
**Power:** >80% for all primary outcomes
**Budget:** $2.15M total

**5 Specific Aims:**
1. Test preservation of autonomous peripheral processes (hair/nail growth)
2. Assess brain hypometabolism correlating with CNS symptoms (FDG-PET)
3. Assess demand-response failure (2-day CPET + muscle biopsies)
4. Test CNS bypass with electrical stimulation
5. Assess autonomic demand-response failure (tilt table + CBF)

## Detailed Protocol

[Note: This is a comprehensive 50+ page research proposal. The full detailed protocol created by the agent includes all sections: Specific Aims (5), Methods, Statistical Analysis, Timeline, Budget ($2.15M breakdown), Regulatory/Ethical, Significance/Innovation, Preliminary Data, Dissemination Plan, and Appendices]

**Key Highlights:**

### Sample & Power
- 36 ME/CFS (12 mild, 12 moderate, 12 severe) + 36 controls
- All aims powered >80% based on published effect sizes
- 20% attrition buffer built in

### Key Predictions Being Tested
1. Hair/nail growth NORMAL (autonomous processes preserved) - **Novel**
2. Brain PET shows hypometabolism correlating with CNS symptoms - **Replicating with correlation**
3. 2-day CPET decline + normal resting muscle ATP - **Replicating + biochemical**
4. Electrical stimulation > voluntary contraction - **Novel CNS bypass test**
5. CBF decline during tilt in 90%+ patients - **Replicating Van Campen 2024**

### Budget Summary ($2.15M)
- Personnel: $960K (PI, Co-Is, coordinator, assistant, statistician)
- Brain imaging (PET): $450K
- Exercise & muscle biopsies: $350K
- Equipment: $190K
- Participant compensation: $80K ($650/person)
- Other: $90K (travel, publications, regulatory)
- Indirect: $637K (30% rate)

### Timeline
- Year 1: Setup, IRB, pilot (n=10)
- Year 2: Main enrollment (target 36 additional)
- Year 3: Final collection, analysis, publication

### Expected Publications
- 4-5 papers targeting *Nature Medicine*, *Lancet Neurology*, *Brain*, *J Appl Physiol*
- Protocol paper at Month 12
- Primary results paper at Month 33
- Open access data sharing via NIH repositories

## Clinical Impact

**If hypothesis validated:**
- Reorients ME/CFS research toward CNS energy metabolism
- Provides rationale for brain-targeted therapies (ketogenic diet, intranasal insulin, CBF enhancers)
- Validates pacing and energy envelope strategies
- Contraindicated "push through" approaches
- Enables biomarker-based diagnosis (2-day CPET, brain PET)

**If hypothesis refuted:**
- Still advances field with high-quality multi-modal data
- Negative findings rule out major mechanistic model
- Enables alternative hypothesis generation

## Status

**DRAFT for review and refinement**

**Next Steps:**
1. Identify PI and institutional home
2. Circulate to ME/CFS research community for feedback
3. Submit LOI to funding agencies
4. Prepare full R01 application

**Target Submission:** NIH R01 October 2026 cycle
