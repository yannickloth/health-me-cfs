# Autonomic Demand-Response Dysfunction in ME/CFS: Literature Review

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Purpose:** Literature review of autonomic function and demand-response patterns

---

## Executive Summary

ME/CFS patients show consistent autonomic dysfunction characterized by:

1. **High prevalence of orthostatic intolerance** (50-97%)
2. **Reduced HRV** indicating sympathetic hyperactivity
3. **Complex catecholamine dysregulation**
4. **Profound CBF reductions** during orthostatic challenge (3-fold > controls)
5. **Preserved baseline, impaired challenge response** - consistent with demand-response failure
6. **Pharmacological bypass works** - dysfunction is regulatory, not structural

---

## Key Finding: Cerebral Blood Flow

**Most consistent and striking finding:**

- **82%** of patients with normal HR/BP showed abnormal CBF reduction
- **91-100%** of ME/CFS patients have abnormal CBF decline during tilt
- **3-fold greater reduction** than healthy controls
- Even patients with "normal" vital signs show profound CBF reductions

**Critical insight:** Standard orthostatic vital signs miss the primary pathology

## Demand-Response Failure Pattern

### Preserved Baseline with Impaired Challenge Response

**Baseline:**
- Some parameters normal at rest
- Many show baseline abnormalities (elevated HR, altered HRV)

**Challenge response:**
- Profound CBF reductions during tilt
- Inadequate heart rate increase (chronotropic incompetence)
- Failure to maintain blood pressure
- Prolonged recovery (hours to days)

### Multiple Challenge Types Affected

- **Orthostatic stress** - CBF reduction, POTS
- **Exercise** - Abnormal 2-day CPET results
- **Cognitive** - Fatigue elevated 24h post-challenge

---

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

### Core Findings

- Lower SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50 (time-domain)
- Lower HF, higher LF/HF ratio (sympathetic predominance)
- Higher resting HR during sleep
- Four distinct autonomic phenotypes identified

### Clinical Utility

- HRV predicts fatigue severity
- Non-invasive, objective biomarker potential
- Can track disease progression

## CNS vs Peripheral Dysfunction

### Evidence for CNS Involvement

- Impaired brainstem connectivity on fMRI
- Clusters in hypothalamus/brainstem
- CNS inflammation can amplify peripheral signals
- Mechanisms include impaired CBF, central adrenergic hyperactivity

### Evidence for Peripheral Involvement

- Some symptoms point to peripheral organ dysfunction
- Peripheral-central sensitization loop hypothesized
- 2021 study: "Problems likely in peripheral mechanisms"

### Integration

**Current understanding:** Both CNS and peripheral involved - integrated systemic dysfunction with bidirectional effects

---

## Pharmacological Interventions (CNS Bypass)

### Midodrine (Alpha-1 Agonist)

- Correction of dysautonomia → improvement of fatigue
- Consistent with dysautonomia playing major role
- **Demonstrates autonomic dysfunction is functionally reversible**

### Fludrocortisone

- Volume expansion + vascular sensitivity
- Improves orthostatic symptoms

### Stimulants

- Majority report benefits (2025 survey)
- 17-21% worsen - highlights heterogeneity
- Direct sympathomimetic bypasses impaired regulation

**Key insight:** Pharmacological bypass improves symptoms → dysfunction is regulation/coordination, not end-organ failure

---

## Relevance to Selective Energy Dysfunction Hypothesis

### Strong Support

1. **Demand-response failure pattern** - baseline preserved, challenge fails
2. **Multi-system involvement** - not single organ
3. **Prolonged recovery** - consistent with reserve depletion
4. **Not deconditioning** - abnormalities regardless of fitness
5. **Functionally reversible** - bypass works

### Proposed Mechanism

1. Primary bioenergetic deficit
2. CNS senses constraint, alters autonomic regulation
3. Maintains baseline by restricting "non-essential" functions
4. During challenge, insufficient energy to upregulate multiple systems
5. Post-challenge depletion requires extended recovery

**Autonomic dysfunction may be adaptive response to underlying bioenergetic deficit**
