# Creative Brainstorming: Selective Energy Dysfunction Hypothesis

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Speculative - hypotheses for investigation

---

## Novel Mechanistic Hypotheses

### 1. The "Astrocyte Energy Gate" Hypothesis

The brain's unique energy architecture creates CNS-specific vulnerability:

- **Astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS)** - neurons depend on astrocytes for fuel
- Astrocytes convert glucose → lactate → neurons
- **If this gate malfunctions**, neurons starve while peripheral tissues (with direct glucose access) are fine

**Hair follicles operate autonomous internal Cori cycles** - no CNS coordination needed

**Testable:** Compare lactate transport markers in CSF vs blood

### 2. The "CNS Energy Triage" Hypothesis

The brain operates hardwired prioritization during energy scarcity:

**Priority hierarchy:**
1. Brainstem vital functions (preserved even in severe ME/CFS)
2. Basic sensory processing
3. Language comprehension
4. Motor control
5. Executive function (sacrificed early)
6. Cognitive flexibility (sacrificed early)

**ME/CFS = triage system chronically engaged**

**Testable:** Map which cognitive functions fail first; should match triage hierarchy

### 3. The "BBB Vulnerability" Hypothesis

Blood-brain barrier creates CNS-specific vulnerability:

- **Traps damage signals** - mtDNA leakage triggers cGAS-STING → neuroinflammation
- **Limits cofactor access** - B12, folate, CoQ10 have limited BBB penetration
- **Prevents rapid mitochondrial turnover** - neurons can't replace damaged mitochondria quickly

**Testable:** Compare CSF vs blood mitochondrial damage markers

### 4. The "Sickness Behavior Stuck On" Hypothesis

ME/CFS = evolutionary sickness behavior program that won't turn off:

**Sickness behavior includes:**
- Fatigue, social withdrawal, anhedonia
- Reduced appetite, sleep changes
- Conservation of energy for immune function

**Critical insight:** Sickness behavior targets behavioral outputs through CNS but was never designed to suppress truly local autonomous processes (hair, nails)

**Why stuck?** Chronic low-grade immune activation keeps triggering the program

### 5. The "Partial Torpor Trap" Hypothesis

Connection to hibernation/torpor research:

**Torpor involves:**
- Hypothalamic signal to reduce metabolic rate
- Coordinated reduction of all systems
- Arousal when energy available

**ME/CFS might be:**
- Partial torpor signal (not complete)
- Uncoordinated reduction - some systems down, others not
- Arousal signals failing

**Testable:** Measure torpor markers (H2S, adenosine, orexin)

## Cross-Domain Connections

### Locked-In Syndrome / Anesthesia / Coma

These states prove peripheral tissues CAN function without CNS coordination:
- Hair grows, wounds heal, cells divide
- ME/CFS might be partial "chemical coma" of non-essential circuits

### Other Diseases with Selective Patterns

- **Parkinson's:** Selective dopaminergic death, peripheral preserved
- **MS:** Selective demyelination, fatigue disproportionate to lesions
- **Common thread:** CNS-mediated fatigue spares peripheral autonomous processes

---

## Paradoxes Resolved

### Why some autonomous processes impaired (digestion) but not others (hair)?

**Resolution:** Distinction is not "autonomous vs controlled" but "CNS-coordinated vs truly local"

- **Digestion:** Requires vagal input, enteric-CNS coordination → impaired
- **Hair growth:** Truly local, follicle operates independently → preserved

### Why doesn't rest fully restore function?

**Resolution options:**
1. Active inhibition, not passive depletion (torpor/sickness behavior signal)
2. Structural damage requiring repair (not just energy refill)
3. Set-point shift (brain recalibrated "safe" activity level)

### Why are some cognitive functions more affected?

**Resolution:** Different energy costs and neural substrates

- **High-cost (severely affected):** Working memory, executive function, novel tasks
- **Low-cost (preserved):** Automatic skills, recognition, practiced routines

---

## Novel Testable Predictions

### Strongly Support Hypothesis If True:

1. **Hair follicle mitochondria normal** in ME/CFS patients
2. **CSF-to-blood lactate gradient abnormal**
3. **Peripheral ATP preserved during PEM** (CNS-localized dysfunction)
4. **Intranasal delivery outperforms oral** for CNS-targeted compounds
5. **Hair/nail growth unchanged during crashes**

### Would Refute Hypothesis If True:

1. Global mitochondrial dysfunction across all tissues equally
2. Hair/nail growth impaired proportionally to CNS symptoms
3. No BBB involvement (normal CSF vs blood metabolites)
4. Treatments work equally regardless of CNS access

## Subtype Framework

### Subtype A: CNS-Primary
- Predominant: cognitive dysfunction, brain fog
- Preserved: physical capacity, autonomic function
- Biomarkers: CSF abnormalities, neuroimaging
- Treatment: CNS-targeted approaches

### Subtype B: Autonomic-Primary
- Predominant: POTS, temperature dysregulation
- Preserved: baseline cognition
- Biomarkers: HRV abnormalities, tilt-table
- Treatment: Autonomic modulators

### Subtype C: Peripheral-Primary
- Predominant: Muscle weakness, exercise intolerance
- Preserved: cognitive function at rest
- Biomarkers: Muscle biopsy, CPET
- Treatment: Mitochondrial support

### Subtype D: Systemic/Global
- All systems affected
- Advanced/severe disease
- Multi-targeted treatment needed

## Treatment Implications

### Novel Treatments Suggested:

1. **Intranasal NAD+/NMN** - bypass BBB
2. **Astrocyte modulators** - restore lactate shuttle
3. **Torpor-arousal promoters** - orexin agonists
4. **Exogenous lactate** - if ANLS impaired

### Existing Treatments Reframed:

- **LDN:** Reduces astrocyte reactivity
- **Pacing:** Stays within demand-response capacity
- **Ketogenic diet:** Ketones bypass some glucose transport limitations

### Treatments That Should NOT Work:

- **GET:** Pushing through inhibition causes damage
- **Stimulants alone:** Override inhibition without fixing cause
- **Peripheral-only supplements:** Don't cross BBB

## Research Priorities

1. **Multi-tissue mitochondrial comparison** (hair vs muscle vs CSF)
2. **Demand-challenge with compartmental imaging**
3. **Torpor marker panel**
4. **Astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle imaging**
5. **Treatment response by proposed subtype**
