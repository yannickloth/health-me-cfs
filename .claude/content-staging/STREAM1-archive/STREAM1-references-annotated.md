## Primary Citations from Stream 1 Research

### 1. Maes et al., 2023
**Title:** Increased gut permeability and bacterial translocation are associated with fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: implications for disease-related biomarker discovery

**Journal:** Frontiers in Immunology
**DOI:** 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1253121

**Summary:** Cross-sectional pilot study (n=30 ME/CFS, n=26 controls) demonstrating significantly elevated zonulin-1, LPS, and sCD14 in ME/CFS patients, establishing baseline gut barrier dysfunction independent of exercise.

**Relevance to Stream 1:** Direct evidence of chronic baseline gut permeability in ME/CFS; critical for establishing that wheat-primed barrier dysfunction exists even in bedbound patients without traditional exercise testing.

### 2. van Wijck et al., 2011
**Title:** Exercise-induced splanchnic hypoperfusion results in gut dysfunction in healthy men

**Journal:** PLOS One
**DOI:** 10.1371/journal.pone.0022366

**Summary:** Controlled exercise study showing 60 minutes at 70% VO2max causes I-FABP elevation and increased intestinal permeability in healthy men, with portal blood flow decreasing 20% at 10 minutes and 80% at 60 minutes.

**Relevance to Stream 1:** Establishes low threshold for splanchnic hypoperfusion in healthy controls; provides mechanistic basis for inferring even lower thresholds in ME/CFS patients with reduced VO2max.

**Title:** Physiology and pathophysiology of splanchnic hypoperfusion and intestinal injury during exercise: strategies for evaluation and prevention

**Journal:** American Journal of Physiology - Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology
**DOI:** 10.1152/ajpgi.00066.2012

**Summary:** Comprehensive review of splanchnic hypoperfusion mechanisms during exercise, establishing time course: 10-minute onset of hypoperfusion, 20-minute lag to epithelial injury.

**Relevance to Stream 1:** Clarifies temporal dynamics of gut barrier injury during sympathetic activation; supports hypothesis that minimal activities in severe ME/CFS can trigger equivalent hypoperfusion.

**Title:** Cerebral Blood Flow Is Reduced in Severe Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Patients During Mild Orthostatic Stress Testing: An Exploratory Study at 20 Degrees of Head-Up Tilt Testing

**Journal:** Healthcare (MDPI)
**PMCID:** PMC7349207

**Summary:** Study demonstrating 27% reduction in cerebral blood flow in severe ME/CFS patients during minimal orthostatic challenge (20-degree head-up tilt), compared to 7% in healthy controls.

**Relevance to Stream 1:** Critical evidence that severe ME/CFS patients show exaggerated vascular redistribution during minimal postural stress; supports inference of similar splanchnic hypoperfusion during activities of daily living.

### 5. Komaroff et al., 2021
**Title:** A Comprehensive Examination of Severely Ill ME/CFS Patients

**Journal:** Healthcare (MDPI)
**PMCID:** PMC8535418

**Summary:** Comprehensive biomarker panel in severely ill (housebound) ME/CFS patients showing lower morning cortisol (p=0.002), altered cholesterol/HDL ratio, and reduced albumin vs. controls.

**Relevance to Stream 1:** Defines biomarker profile of severe patients; low cortisol and albumin suggest reduced capacity for barrier repair; orthostatic intolerance in 45% supports splanchnic dysregulation hypothesis.

### 6. Montoya et al., 2017
**Title:** Cytokine signature associated with disease severity in chronic fatigue syndrome patients

**Journal:** PNAS
**DOI:** 10.1073/pnas.1710519114

**Summary:** Large cohort study (n=192 ME/CFS, n=392 controls) identifying 17 cytokines correlating with disease severity, 13 of which are proinflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, etc.).

**Relevance to Stream 1:** Establishes inflammation-severity relationship; several identified cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ) are known to disrupt gut barrier function, supporting bidirectional gut-inflammation cycle in severe patients.

### 7. Multiple Sources (PEM Mechanisms)
**Key Sources:**
- Solve ME/CFS Initiative (PEM overview)
- PMC11899462 (Cognitive dysfunction and PEM)

**Summary:** Cognitive, emotional, social, and physical exertion all trigger post-exertional malaise; brain response patterns differ 24 hours post-exercise in ME/CFS vs. controls; CNS outcomes predict PEM onset.

**Relevance to Stream 1:** Expands definition of "exercise" beyond physical activity; supports hypothesis that any sympathetic activation (cognitive work, emotional stress) can trigger splanchnic redistribution in severe patients.

---

### 8. Multiple Sources (POTS Mechanisms)
**Key Sources:**
- Dysautonomia Information Network (POTS overview)
- Johns Hopkins Medicine (POTS mechanisms)
- Open Medicine Foundation (Orthostatic intolerance in ME/CFS)

**Summary:** Splanchnic vascular bed contains 30% of blood volume; POTS patients show excessive abdominal blood pooling even at rest; neuropathic and normal-flow POTS subtypes involve splanchnic dysregulation; abdominal compression (40 mmHg) reduces pooling.

**Relevance to Stream 1:** High ME/CFS-POTS comorbidity suggests shared splanchnic dysregulation; baseline splanchnic pooling may be chronic in severe patients, worsened by any activity.
