## Integration Recommendations

**Highest Priority for Integration (Certainty ≥ 0.50):**
1. Hypothesis 7: Memory Triage Consequence (0.55)
2. Hypothesis 8: Motor-Autonomic Overload (0.55)
3. Hypothesis 1: Sleep Architecture Failure (0.50)
4. Hypothesis 5: Circadian Distribution Failure (0.50)

**Novel Connections to Existing Literature:**
- GPCR Autoantibodies (H3): Well-documented in 30% but mechanism unclear
- Small Fiber Neuropathy (H4): Found in ~30%, relationship uncertain
- Microbiome Changes (H2): Consistent dysbiosis but causation unclear
- MCAS Overlap (H6): High comorbidity without mechanistic link

**Next Steps:**
1. Test H7, H8, H1 with neuroimaging + cognitive battery
2. Leverage UK Biobank / DecodeME for retrospective analysis
3. Design multi-hypothesis protocols testing 3-4 predictions simultaneously

**Status:** Preliminary - requires peer review and empirical testing
