# Patient Survey: Hair and Nail Health in ME/CFS

**Purpose:** Test the prediction that hair and nail growth remain preserved in ME/CFS despite severe energy dysfunction in CNS-dependent systems.

**Hypothesis:** The selective energy dysfunction hypothesis predicts that truly autonomous peripheral processes (hair follicle cycling, nail growth) that operate independently of CNS coordination should be preserved even in severe ME/CFS.

**Date Created:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Draft - Ready for validation

## Data Analysis Plan

### Primary Outcome Measures

1. **Hair growth rate:** Proportion reporting "about the same" or "faster" vs "slower"
2. **Nail growth rate:** Proportion reporting "about the same" or "faster" vs "slower"
3. **Hair/nail quality:** Composite score from thickness, strength, appearance questions

### Comparison Groups

- **ME/CFS vs healthy controls:** Expect NO difference (hypothesis prediction)
- **ME/CFS severity stratification:** Expect NO correlation between severity and hair/nail health
- **ME/CFS vs depression controls:** Differentiate energy dysfunction from psychological factors
- **ME/CFS vs autoimmune controls:** Control for inflammation effects

### Secondary Analyses

1. **Correlation analysis:** Hair/nail health vs:
   - Disease severity (Bell Scale)
   - Disease duration
   - Cognitive impairment severity
   - Exercise intolerance severity
   - PEM severity

2. **Subgroup analysis:**
   - By ME/CFS subtype (if identifiable)
   - By comorbidities
   - By nutritional status (excluding malnourished patients)
   - By age/hormonal status

3. **Confounding factor adjustment:**
   - Exclude patients with known confounders (thyroid disease, nutritional deficiency, chemotherapy)
   - Sensitivity analysis with/without these exclusions

### Statistical Methods

- **Descriptive statistics:** Frequencies, proportions, means
- **Group comparisons:** Chi-square for categorical, t-test/ANOVA for continuous
- **Correlation:** Spearman's rho for severity correlations
- **Multivariate:** Logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, nutritional status

### Hypothesis Testing

**Null hypothesis:** ME/CFS patients have slower hair/nail growth than controls

**Alternative hypothesis (selective dysfunction model):** ME/CFS patients have preserved hair/nail growth despite severe impairment in CNS-dependent functions

**Predicted results if hypothesis TRUE:**
- Hair/nail growth: ME/CFS ≈ healthy controls
- Hair/nail growth: NO correlation with disease severity
- Hair/nail health: Preserved even in severe/very severe patients
- Contrast: Muscle strength, cognition, exercise capacity all impaired

**Predicted results if hypothesis FALSE:**
- Hair/nail growth: ME/CFS < healthy controls
- Hair/nail growth: Negative correlation with severity
- Hair/nail health: Impaired proportionally to other systems

## Implementation Considerations

### Recruitment Strategy

**Target sample size:**
- ME/CFS cohort: n=200 minimum (50 mild, 50 moderate, 50 severe, 50 very severe)
- Healthy controls: n=100
- Disease controls: n=50 each (depression, autoimmune)

**Recruitment channels:**
- ME/CFS advocacy organizations (ME Action, Phoenix Rising, etc.)
- Specialized ME/CFS clinics
- Online patient communities (with moderator approval)
- Social media (ME/CFS hashtags)
- Research registries (MEandYou, UK ME Biobank, etc.)

### Quality Control

**Validation checks:**
- Response time (flag <2 min or >60 min as potential quality issues)
- Internal consistency (contradictory responses)
- Free text review for misunderstanding of questions

**Pilot phase:**
- 10-20 patients complete survey
- Cognitive interview: "What did you understand this question to mean?"
- Revise ambiguous questions
- Test readability score (target: 8th grade reading level)

### Ethical Considerations

**Informed consent:**
- Clear explanation that survey is for research
- Right to withdraw at any time
- Data use and privacy protections
- No compensation required (but consider small thank-you gift)

**Sensitive topics:**
- Acknowledge that hair loss can be emotionally difficult
- Option to skip questions if distressing
- Provide resources for body image support if needed

**Accessibility:**
- Screen reader compatible
- Option for caregiver assistance
- Simple language, no medical jargon
- Estimated time prominently displayed

## Validation and Limitations

### Potential Biases

1. **Recall bias:** Patients may not accurately remember pre-illness hair/nail status
   - *Mitigation:* Include "don't know" option, compare to age-matched controls

2. **Selection bias:** Patients with hair loss may be more/less likely to respond
   - *Mitigation:* Recruit from diverse channels, not just hair-focused forums

3. **Confounding:** Thyroid disease, nutritional deficiencies very common in ME/CFS
   - *Mitigation:* Collect detailed confounder data, perform sensitivity analyses

4. **Subjective assessment:** Self-report may not match objective measures
   - *Mitigation:* Request objective measurements where available, optional photo uploads

### Strengthening the Study

**Objective measurements substudy:**
- Recruit subset willing to measure hair/nail growth prospectively
- Provide standardized instructions and measurement tools
- Track growth over 3-6 months

**Biomarker correlation:**
- Partner with biobank studies
- Link survey responses to hair follicle biopsy data (mitochondrial function)
- Test prediction: follicle mitochondria should be normal

**Longitudinal component:**
- Re-survey subset at 6 and 12 months
- Track changes with disease severity
- Test prediction: hair/nail should remain stable even if ME/CFS worsens

---

## Expected Results and Interpretation

### If Hypothesis Supported

**Expected pattern:**
- Hair/nail growth: **Preserved** (similar to controls)
- Hair/nail quality: **Normal or near-normal** even in severe ME/CFS
- **No correlation** between hair/nail health and disease severity
- **Strong contrast** to impaired muscle, cognitive, autonomic function

**Interpretation:**
- Supports selective dysfunction model
- Autonomous peripheral processes spared
- CNS-dependent processes preferentially affected
- Implicates brain/coordination as primary dysfunction

**Clinical implications:**
- Hair/nail health should NOT be used as severity indicator
- Focus treatment on CNS energy support
- Brain-centric interventions may have broader benefits

### If Hypothesis Refuted

**Pattern if global dysfunction:**
- Hair/nail growth: **Impaired** proportionally to disease severity
- Quality: **Decreases** with worsening ME/CFS
- **Strong correlation** between hair/nail and other systems

**Interpretation:**
- Global cellular energy failure, not selective
- All high-energy processes affected equally
- Mitochondrial dysfunction is systemic
- Brain symptoms are one manifestation among many

**Clinical implications:**
- System-wide mitochondrial support needed
- No specific CNS targeting advantage
- Hair/nail changes could be biomarkers of severity

### Null Results

**No clear pattern:**
- High heterogeneity, no consistent trend
- May indicate ME/CFS subtypes with different patterns
- Some patients show preserved hair/nails, others don't

**Interpretation:**
- Supports disease heterogeneity
- Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms
- Selective dysfunction may apply to subset only
- Need for subtype-specific analysis
