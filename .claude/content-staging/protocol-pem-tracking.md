# PEM Self-Tracking Protocol: Testing Selective Energy Dysfunction

**Status:** Research Protocol (Patient-Facing)
**Purpose:** Document Post-Exertional Malaise triggers and severity to test the Selective Energy Dysfunction Hypothesis
**Date Created:** 2026-02-04
**Target Users:** ME/CFS patients with ability to track symptoms over 4-8 week periods

---

## Executive Summary for Patients

This protocol helps you track what triggers your crashes and how severe they are. By recording **what you do** and **how bad the crash is**, we can see if crashes are worse after certain types of activities.

The hypothesis being tested: **Brain-demanding activities might cause worse crashes than physical activities.**

You don't need to be perfect—even rough tracking helps. Brain fog is OK; we've designed this for that.

---

## Part 1: The Simple Version (Start Here)

### Three Things to Track Daily

**1. What did you do?** (Activity)
- Type: Cognitive / Physical / Emotional / Passive (choose one)
- Example: "worked on computer 45 min (Cognitive)" or "walked 20 min (Physical)"

**2. Did you crash?** (PEM Occurrence)
- Yes / No
- If yes, rate severity: Mild (1-3) / Moderate (4-6) / Severe (7-10)

**3. When did it start?** (Onset Timeline)
- Same day / Next day / 2+ days later

### Where to Record

**Use a simple template in your phone notes, spreadsheet, or paper notebook:**

```
DATE | ACTIVITY & TYPE | PEM? | SEVERITY | ONSET | NOTES
-----|-----------------|------|----------|-------|-------
2/4  | Computer 45min  | Yes  | 6/10     | +1day | Brain fog worse
     | (Cognitive)     |      |          |       | than physical
```

That's it. This basic tracking alone can test the hypothesis.

**If you're not ready for more detail yet, stop here and use this simple version for 4 weeks. We can analyze it to see patterns.**

## Part 2: The Complete Protocol (If You Have Energy for It)

### Overview: Full Recording System

**Complete tracking includes:**
1. **Activity inventory** - What you did, broken into components
2. **Activity categorization** - By CNS involvement level (the hypothesis)
3. **PEM timeline** - When symptoms appeared and how they changed
4. **Severity ratings** - Using multiple dimensions
5. **Recovery tracking** - How long you took to bounce back

---

## Section A: Activity Categorization System

### The Core Idea

The hypothesis predicts:
- **Pure cognitive exertion** (brain-heavy) → worse PEM
- **Physical exertion** (muscle + coordination) → bad PEM
- **Emotional stress** (brain + autonomic) → bad PEM
- **Passive activities** (minimal brain) → less PEM

We're categorizing activities by **how much your brain had to work**.

### Category 1: Cognitive Exertion (PURE CNS)

**Definition:** Activities requiring active mental work without physical effort.

**Brain systems involved:**
- Executive function (planning, decision-making)
- Working memory (holding information)
- Attention (sustained focus)
- Language processing
- Novel problem-solving

**Examples:**
- Reading complex material (30 min)
- Puzzle solving or games requiring strategy
- Writing or composition (emails, lists, creative writing)
- Learning new information
- Making difficult decisions
- Problem-solving ("what should I wear?", budgeting)
- Online shopping with choices
- Video calls with focus required
- Arithmetic or financial planning
- Planning activities/appointments

**Components to record:**
- Duration: ___ minutes
- Difficulty: Easy / Moderate / Hard / Very Hard
- Continuous or broken into chunks? ___
- Background demands: (quiet environment? interruptions? stress about getting it right?)
- Novel vs routine: New task / Familiar task

**Example full entry:**
> **Activity:** Online shopping for groceries
> - Type: Cognitive
> - Duration: 25 minutes continuous
> - Difficulty: Moderate (comparing options, decision fatigue)
> - Background: Multiple interruptions, feeling pressured to decide quickly
> - Novel: Routine

---

### Category 2: Physical Exertion (Physical + CNS Coordination)

**Definition:** Activities requiring muscle work that also needs CNS coordination and demand-responsiveness.

**Why it's not "pure physical":** Your brain has to coordinate your muscles, decide how hard to push, regulate breathing, maintain balance, etc.

**Brain systems involved:**
- Motor planning (cerebellum, motor cortex)
- Demand-responsiveness (adjusting intensity)
- Proprioception (knowing where your body is)
- Autonomic regulation (heart rate, breathing)

**Examples:**
- Walking indoors on flat surface (10 min) - LOW demand
- Walking outdoors with uneven terrain (15 min) - MEDIUM demand
- Stairs (1 flight) - MEDIUM-HIGH demand
- Carrying items (groceries, laundry) - MEDIUM demand
- Standing activity (cooking, shower) - MEDIUM demand
- Stretching or gentle movement - LOW demand
- Playing with children/pets - HIGH demand (unpredictable movements)
- Housework (vacuuming, cleaning) - MEDIUM-HIGH demand
- Gardening (digging, carrying) - HIGH demand
- Cycling or swimming - HIGH demand (sustained)
- Sports or dancing - VERY HIGH demand

**Components to record:**
- Duration: ___ minutes
- Intensity: Very light / Light / Moderate / Hard / Very hard
- Type of movement: walking / standing / carrying / climbing / other ___
- Continuous or with breaks? ___
- Did you have to pay attention or could you "autopilot"? ___
- Environmental factors: stairs, uneven ground, carrying weight, heat, etc. ___

**Example full entry:**
> **Activity:** Walking to store
> - Type: Physical
> - Duration: 20 minutes continuous
> - Intensity: Moderate (normal walking speed, slight uphill)
> - Type: Walking outdoors
> - Autopilot or focused? Had to watch for traffic and uneven sidewalk
> - Environment: Outdoor, stairs at entrance (3), carried backpack

---

### Category 3: Emotional/Autonomic Stress (CNS + Autonomic)

**Definition:** Experiences causing emotional arousal, requiring active autonomic regulation.

**Brain systems involved:**
- Amygdala (emotional processing)
- Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (stress response)
- Autonomic nervous system (sympathetic activation)
- Executive function (emotional regulation)

**Why this matters:** Emotional stress demands the same CNS systems as cognitive exertion, PLUS it activates the autonomic system, which is also dysfunctional in ME/CFS.

**Examples:**
- Difficult conversation / conflict
- Receiving bad news
- Worrying about something
- Anticipatory anxiety (dreading an appointment)
- Excitement or heightened engagement
- Frustration when something doesn't work
- Social interaction with performance demand (phone call, video meeting, conversation)
- Medical appointment or test
- Being in unfamiliar or unpredictable social situation

**Components to record:**
- Type of stressor: (conflict / bad news / anticipation / performance / other)
- Duration: ___ minutes
- Intensity: Mild / Moderate / Intense / Very intense
- Your emotional reaction: (describe briefly)
- Did you "feel it in your body"? (racing heart / nausea / shaking / etc.)
- Recovered emotionally immediately or took time? ___

**Example full entry:**
> **Activity:** Difficult phone call with family member
> - Type: Emotional stress
> - Duration: 18 minutes
> - Intensity: Intense (disagreement, felt unheard)
> - Felt in body: Heart racing, chest tight, trembling
> - Recovery: Still upset 2 hours later

---

### Category 4: Passive/Minimal CNS Activity (Baseline)

**Definition:** Activities that don't require active mental or physical effort or emotional regulation.

**Brain systems involved:**
- Sensory processing (but not decision-making)
- Automatic/habitual neural pathways
- Minimal demand-responsiveness

**Why track these:** These should NOT trigger PEM if the hypothesis is correct. If they do, it suggests something else is wrong.

**Examples:**
- Watching TV (no planning of what to watch, passive) - LOW demand
- Listening to music or podcast (passive) - LOW demand
- Reading for pleasure (automatic, not learning new material) - LOW demand
- Eating or drinking - LOW demand
- Resting or lying down - ZERO demand
- Routine self-care (hygiene, using bathroom) - LOW demand
- Being outside in nature without doing anything specific - VERY LOW demand

**NOT in this category (even though they seem "passive"):**
- Watching TV trying to follow a complex plot - COGNITIVE
- Reading something you need to understand - COGNITIVE
- Showering (proprioception + coordination) - PHYSICAL
- Being at a party (even if quiet) - EMOTIONAL

**Components to record:**
- Type: (TV / reading / resting / eating / other)
- Duration: ___ minutes
- Effort required: Essentially zero / Minimal / Some
- Any emotional component? (stress about "wasting time"? worry?) ___

**Example full entry:**
> **Activity:** Watching TV
> - Type: Passive
> - Duration: 45 minutes
> - Effort: Zero (remote-controlled from couch)
> - Show: Rerun of familiar comedy (no need to focus)
> - Emotional: Relaxed, no stress

### Then Track PEM Response (Next Section)

---

## Section C: PEM Tracking System

### Key Definition: What is PEM?

For this protocol, PEM includes any of these that worsen after activity:

**Must have at least ONE:**
- Exhaustion/fatigue disproportionate to exertion
- Cognitive symptoms (brain fog, memory trouble, word-finding)
- Physical symptoms (weakness, tremor, pain, nausea)
- Autonomic symptoms (heart racing, temperature dysregulation)
- Sleep disruption (insomnia or excessive sleeping)

And it must be **WORSE THAN BASELINE** for that patient.

### PEM Occurrence: Did You Have One?

Record this for each activity:

```
PEM OCCURRED?
[ ] No - felt normal or baseline afterward
[ ] Yes, MILD
    - Noticeable but manageable
    - Can still do basic self-care
    - Better within hours or by next day

[ ] Yes, MODERATE
    - Significantly worse than baseline
    - Difficult to do normal activities
    - Better within 1-3 days

[ ] Yes, SEVERE
    - Major worsening of symptoms
    - Bed-bound or near bed-bound
    - Takes 3+ days to recover
```

### PEM Severity Dimensions

**Instead of just "how bad was it," rate multiple dimensions:**

For each dimension, use 0-10 scale where:
- 0 = Not present at all, or the BEST you typically feel
- 5 = Moderate worsening from baseline
- 10 = The worst you've ever felt

**Dimension 1: Fatigue/Exhaustion**
- How overwhelming was the exhaustion?
- Rating: ___ / 10

**Dimension 2: Cognitive Dysfunction**
- Brain fog, memory problems, focus issues
- Rating: ___ / 10

**Dimension 3: Physical Symptoms**
- Weakness, pain, tremor, nausea
- Rating: ___ / 10

**Dimension 4: Autonomic Symptoms**
- Heart racing, breathing hard, temperature issues, dizziness
- Rating: ___ / 10

**Dimension 5: Sleep Disruption**
- Insomnia or excessive sleeping
- Rating: ___ / 10

**Overall Severity: (Average of dimensions above)**
- ___ / 10

---

## Section D: PEM Timeline Tracking

### When Did It Start? How Did It Progress?

**Onset timing** is crucial for testing the hypothesis. Different activity types might have different PEM patterns.

```
ONSET TIMING:
[ ] Within 2 hours (very rapid onset)
[ ] 2-8 hours (same day)
[ ] 8-24 hours (next day, classic)
[ ] 24-48 hours (delayed onset)
[ ] 48+ hours (very delayed)
[ ] No clear onset (gradually worsened)

TIMELINE OF SYMPTOMS (track how it changed):

Immediately after activity (0 hours):
- Fatigue level: ___ / 10
- Other symptoms: ___

2 hours later:
- Fatigue level: ___ / 10
- Other symptoms: ___

Next morning:
- Fatigue level: ___ / 10
- Other symptoms: ___

24 hours after activity:
- Fatigue level: ___ / 10
- Other symptoms: ___

48 hours after activity:
- Fatigue level: ___ / 10
- Other symptoms: ___

RECOVERY POINT (when did it return to baseline?):
- Days to recovery: ___
- Are baseline symptoms fully normal or permanently worsened? ___
```

### Example Timeline

```

- Physical: Normal

24 hours:
- Back to baseline

RECOVERY: Same day (no actual PEM, just normal post-activity fatigue)
```

---

## Section E: Pattern Analysis (Weekly Review)

### What to Look For

**Every week, review your logs and look for patterns:**

**Question 1: Which activity types caused the worst PEM?**

Make a simple table:

```
ACTIVITY TYPE | # TIMES DID IT | # TIMES GOT PEM | AVG SEVERITY
Cognitive     | 8              | 7               | 6.5/10
Physical      | 6              | 5               | 5.2/10
Emotional     | 3              | 3               | 7.1/10
Passive       | 10             | 0               | 0/10
```

**Pattern to look for:** Is cognitive exertion triggering the WORST PEM?

---

**Question 2: How fast does PEM start after different activities?**

```
ACTIVITY TYPE | TYPICAL ONSET
Cognitive     | 8-24 hours (delayed)
Physical      | 2-8 hours (faster)
Emotional     | Variable
Passive       | No PEM
```

---

**Question 3: How long does recovery take?**

```
ACTIVITY TYPE | TYPICAL RECOVERY TIME
Cognitive     | 48-72 hours (LONGER)
Physical      | 24-48 hours
Emotional     | 24-48 hours
Passive       | 0 hours
```

**Pattern to look for:** Do cognitive activities take LONGER to recover from?

---

## Section F: Data Recording Methods (Pick One)

### Option 1: Minimal Tracking (Pen and Paper)

Print this simple weekly sheet:

```
WEEK OF: _______________

Mon: Activity _____ | Type _____ | PEM Y/N | Severity ___
Tue: Activity _____ | Type _____ | PEM Y/N | Severity ___
Wed: Activity _____ | Type _____ | PEM Y/N | Severity ___
Thu: Activity _____ | Type _____ | PEM Y/N | Severity ___
Fri: Activity _____ | Type _____ | PEM Y/N | Severity ___
Sat: Activity _____ | Type _____ | PEM Y/N | Severity ___
Sun: Activity _____ | Type _____ | PEM Y/N | Severity ___

PATTERNS THIS WEEK:
Most triggering activity type: _______________
Worst PEM severity: _____ / 10
Typical recovery time: _____ days
```

**Advantage:** Extremely simple, doesn't require electronics

---

### Option 2: Spreadsheet (Google Sheets or Excel)

Create columns:

| DATE | TIME | ACTIVITY | DURATION | TYPE | INTENSITY | PEM? | SEVERITY | ONSET | RECOVERY_DAYS | NOTES |
|------|------|----------|----------|------|-----------|------|----------|-------|---------------|-------|
| 2/4 | 2pm | Grocery shopping | 25 | Cognitive | Medium | Yes | 7 | 12hr | 3 | Brain fog worse |
| 2/4 | 3pm | Walk | 20 | Physical | Light | No | 0 | - | 0 | Normal fatigue |

**Advantage:** Easy to sort and filter; see patterns over time

---

### Option 3: Voice Recording

If writing is hard, use voice memo:

> "February 4th, 2pm. Did 25 minutes of online shopping. Cognitive activity, moderate difficulty. Got PEM starting around 12 hours later, severity about 7 out of 10. Brain fog was the worst part. Took 3 days to recover."

Then transcribe weekly or have someone help organize.

**Advantage:** No writing required, captures tone/details

---

### Option 4: Shared Log with Caregiver

If a caregiver/partner is helping, they can record observations:

```
DATE | TIME | WHAT PATIENT DID | PATIENT'S ACTIVITY TYPE CHOICE |
     |      | CAREGIVER'S NOTE | NEXT DAY SYMPTOMS |

2/4  | 2pm  | Spent 25 min shopping online | Patient said "Cognitive" |
     |      | I noticed: She was focused, | Next day: Much foggier |
     |      | seemed like it took | than usual, didn't |
     |      | concentration | recognize me at first |
```

---

## Section G: Scientific Analysis (Monthly Review)

### After 4 Weeks, Analyze Your Data

**Step 1: Make a Summary Table**

```
For each activity type, calculate:
- Total times done
- Times that triggered PEM
- Average PEM severity when it occurred
- Average recovery time

Example:
COGNITIVE
- Done 8 times
- Triggered PEM 7 times (87.5%)
- Average severity: 6.9/10
- Average recovery: 62 hours (2.6 days)

PHYSICAL
- Done 6 times
- Triggered PEM 4 times (67%)
- Average severity: 5.2/10
- Average recovery: 36 hours (1.5 days)

EMOTIONAL
- Done 3 times
- Triggered PEM 3 times (100%)
- Average severity: 7.3/10
- Average recovery: 55 hours (2.3 days)

PASSIVE
- Done 10 times
- Triggered PEM 0 times (0%)
- Average severity: 0/10
- Average recovery: 0 hours
```

**What this tells you:**

If the hypothesis is TRUE, you should see:
- Cognitive > Emotional > Physical > Passive (in severity)
- Cognitive takes longest to recover
- Passive activities DON'T trigger PEM

---

**Step 2: Calculate PEM Probability by Type**

"When I do [activity type], what's the chance I get PEM?"

```
Cognitive: 87.5% (7 out of 8 times)
Physical: 67% (4 out of 6 times)
Emotional: 100% (3 out of 3 times)
Passive: 0% (0 out of 10 times)
```

---

**Step 3: Create Your Personal Hierarchy**

Based on YOUR data, rank activities by PEM risk:

```
MOST TRIGGERING:
1. Emotional stress (100% → PEM)
2. Cognitive exertion (87.5% → PEM)
3. Physical exertion (67% → PEM)
4. Passive activities (0% → PEM)
```

**This is YOUR result.** It might differ from other patients. That's scientifically valuable.

---

**Step 4: Test a Prediction**

Once you see a pattern, TEST it deliberately:

**Example 1 - If cognitive is worst:**
> "I see that computer work triggers worse PEM than walking. This week, I'll:
> - Skip cognitive work on Monday (do passive activities instead)
> - Do a 30-min walk on Tuesday (normal activity)
> - Do cognitive work on Wednesday
>
> Prediction: Wednesday (cognitive) will cause worse PEM than Tuesday (physical)
> Result: _____ (did this match?)"

**Example 2 - If passive never triggers PEM:**
> "My data shows TV and resting never trigger PEM. But I worry rest makes me weak. This week I'll:
> - Rest more than usual (8 extra hours of lying down)
> - Check: Did I crash?
>
> Prediction: Extra rest should NOT cause PEM if it's truly passive
> Result: _____"

---

## Section H: Special Situations

### What If You Have Brain Fog During Tracking?

**No problem.** Use the SIMPLE VERSION (Part 1).

Simple entries that still help:
```
"Feb 4: Computer. Yes crashed. 7/10 bad. Tomorrow it started."

"Feb 5: Walk. No crash."

"Feb 6: Stressed call. Yes bad. Got worse next day."
```

**You don't need perfect grammar or complete information.** Any data is better than none.

---

### What If Multiple Things Happened the Same Day?

**Record each activity separately IF possible:**
```
Morning: Walk 20 min (Physical) - No PEM
Afternoon: Conversation 30 min (Emotional) - Yes, PEM started evening
Evening: Watched TV (Passive) - didn't contribute
```

**Or note it as a combo:**
```
Date: Multiple activities
- Walk 20 min (Physical)
- Conversation 30 min (Emotional)
- Result: PEM that night, severity 6/10
- Likely caused by: Emotional + Physical combo
```

---

### What If You Have PEM WITHOUT a Clear Trigger?

**Record it anyway:**
```
PEM occurred but unsure what triggered
- No major cognitive activity (routine stuff)
- No physical exertion
- Maybe stress over the weekend? (not acute)
- Severity: 5/10
- Recovery: 2 days
- Note: Spontaneous flare or cumulative?
```

This still helps identify patterns over time.

---

### What If You're in a Crash?

**Do MINIMAL tracking:**
```
In PEM crash - not tracking activities, but noting recovery progress:
Feb 4-7: In PEM from Feb 4 activity
Day 1 (Feb 4 evening): 9/10 severity
Day 2 (Feb 5): 8/10 severity
Day 3 (Feb 6): 6/10 severity
Day 4 (Feb 7): 5/10, back toward baseline

Total recovery: 72 hours
```

---

## Section I: Safety Boundaries

### Don't Track at the Cost of Your Health

**If tracking becomes:**
- A stressful activity (fear of "getting it wrong")
- So cognitively demanding you're worsening
- Causing guilt or anxiety

**STOP.** Switch to the SIMPLE VERSION or stop temporarily.

**Important:** The goal is to help you MANAGE ME/CFS, not make it worse.

---

### Warning: Avoid Over-Exercising "for science"

Do NOT deliberately trigger severe PEM to gather data. Examples of harmful "testing":
- "I'll push hard on cognitive work to see what happens"
- "I'll ignore my limits to test if passive activities cause PEM"
- "I'll see how long I can push before I crash"

**Okay:** "I notice cognitive work seems to cause crashes. This week I'll just observe when I do it vs when I don't."

**Not okay:** "I'll force myself to do cognitive work longer than safe just to see the PEM."

---

## Section J: Privacy and Data Sharing

### Your Data is Private

**You can:**
- Keep all data private (just for you)
- Share selected insights with your doctor ("I notice cognitive activity triggers worse PEM")
- Use it for disability claims ("My crash data shows...")
- Contribute anonymized data to research (optional)

**You should:**
- Not share identifiable information publicly
- Not feel obligated to share with anyone
- Decide what feels safe for you

---

## Section K: 4-Week Protocol Schedule

### Week 1: Learn and Start Simple

- [ ] Read Part 1 (Simple Version)
- [ ] Start tracking with 3 things: Activity Type / PEM? / Severity

- [ ] Add duration of activities
- [ ] Note if activity was cognitive/physical/emotional/passive

**Goal:** Start seeing patterns

---

### Week 3: Build Timeline Data

- [ ] When you have a PEM, track how bad it was over the next 2-3 days

---

### Week 4: Analysis and Testing

- [ ] Review all 4 weeks of data
- [ ] Create your summary table
- [ ] Calculate PEM probability by activity type
- [ ] Write down YOUR hierarchy of what triggers what

**Optional:** Design one small prediction test for week 5

---

## Section L: Advanced: If You Want to Test More

### Extension Protocols (Weeks 5-8)

**After 4 weeks, if you want to dig deeper:**

#### A. Test the Onset Timing Hypothesis

**Prediction:** Cognitive PEM should be DELAYED (12-48 hours) more often than physical PEM.

**Method:** Track onset timing for 4 more weeks, separated by activity type.

```
COGNITIVE ACTIVITIES: Average onset timing?
- 8 cases: 6 were 12-48hr, 2 were 2-8hr
- Mostly DELAYED onset

PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES: Average onset timing?
- 6 cases: 4 were 2-8hr, 2 were 12-24hr
- Mostly FASTER onset

SUPPORTS HYPOTHESIS: Yes, cognitive has delayed onset
```

---

#### B. Test the Recovery Time Hypothesis

**Prediction:** Cognitive PEM takes longer to recover from than physical PEM.

**Method:** When you have PEM, track daily until back to baseline.

```
Track: How many days until you're back to baseline?

COGNITIVE PEM:
- Case 1: 72 hours
- Case 2: 60 hours
- Case 3: 84 hours
- Average: 72 hours (3 days)

PHYSICAL PEM:
- Case 1: 48 hours
- Case 2: 36 hours
- Case 3: 42 hours
- Average: 42 hours (1.75 days)

Difference: Cognitive takes ~30 hours longer to recover
Supports hypothesis? YES
```

---

#### C. Severity Dimension Analysis

**After 4+ weeks, look at which SYMPTOM is worst after different activities:**

```
After COGNITIVE exertion:
- Brain fog: Usually 7-9/10
- Fatigue: Usually 5-7/10
- Physical: Usually 2-4/10
- Autonomic: Usually 1-3/10

→ Cognitive exertion primarily affects COGNITION (makes sense!)

After PHYSICAL exertion:
- Fatigue: Usually 6-8/10
- Physical (weakness): Usually 5-7/10
- Brain fog: Usually 2-4/10
- Autonomic: Usually 2-3/10

→ Physical exertion primarily affects FATIGUE/weakness

After EMOTIONAL stress:
- Autonomic (racing heart, shaking): 6-8/10
- Fatigue: 5-7/10
- Brain fog: 4-6/10
- Physical: 2-4/10

→ Emotional stress primarily affects AUTONOMIC system
```

**What this means:** Different triggers cause different PEM "signatures." This supports selective dysfunction.

---

## Section M: How to Share Your Data

### If You Want Research to Use This Data

**Important first:** This is OPTIONAL. You don't have to share.

**If you choose to share with researchers:**

1. **Keep identifiable info separate:**
   - Don't include your name, location, medical record number in the data
   - Use code like "Patient #1" or just keep data anonymous

2. **What to share:**
   - Your summary table (activity type, PEM triggers, severity, recovery time)
   - Your personal hierarchy (what triggers what for you)
   - Any patterns you notice

3. **What NOT to share:**
   - Specific medical details (other diagnoses, treatments)
   - Personal life information
   - Anything that makes you identifiable

4. **Format for sharing:**
   ```
   ANONYMOUS PATIENT DATA - PEM TRACKING STUDY

   Demographics (only):
   - Approx age: 40s
   - Gender: [optional]
   - Years since ME/CFS onset: 8

   ACTIVITY TYPE ANALYSIS:
   - Cognitive: 87.5% trigger rate, 6.9/10 avg severity, 62hr recovery
   - Physical: 67% trigger rate, 5.2/10 avg severity, 36hr recovery
   - Emotional: 100% trigger rate, 7.3/10 avg severity, 55hr recovery
   - Passive: 0% trigger rate, 0/10 avg severity, 0hr recovery

   KEY INSIGHT:
   In my case, cognitive exertion triggers the most severe and
   longest-duration PEM, supporting the selective energy dysfunction
   hypothesis (brain-heavy activities cause worse crashes).
   ```

---

## Section N: Troubleshooting

### "I'm worried I'll mess this up"

**You can't.** There's no wrong way to track your own symptoms. Even rough data helps.

**Examples of "enough" data:**
- "Cognitive activity - yes crash - 7/10"
- "Physical - no crash"
- "Emotional stress - yes, severe, took 3 days to get better"

Even one word per field is useful.

### "I forget to track during the day"

**Solutions:**
1. Track weekly instead of daily (less frequent, easier to remember)
2. Use phone voice memo (talk to yourself)
3. Have caregiver track for you
4. Just track the "big activities" that might trigger PEM
5. Only track when you actually have PEM (not every day)

**All valid approaches.**

### "My pattern changes week to week"

**That's valuable data.** Note it:

```
Week 1-2: Cognitive work = 8/10 severity crashes
Week 3-4: Cognitive work = only 5/10 severity crashes

Possible explanations:
- Got better at pacing
- Better baseline health that week
- Different type of cognitive work
- Less stress, so same activity felt easier

→ Still useful to track - shows your capacity fluctuates
```

### "I don't think I have 'pure' cognitive or physical activities"

**Correct.** Most things are mixed. Track what seems MOST dominant:

```
"Grocery shopping online":
- Physical: Minimal (sitting)
- Cognitive: HIGH (deciding, comparing)
- Emotional: Some (decision fatigue)
→ Category as COGNITIVE (that's the biggest component)

"Walking with a friend":
- Physical: MEDIUM (walking)
- Cognitive: Minimal (autopilot)
- Emotional: MEDIUM (social interaction)
→ Category as PHYSICAL + EMOTIONAL (or pick whichever felt harder)

When in doubt, pick the one that felt HARDEST.
```

## Appendix A: Symptom Severity Anchor Points

**For rating PEM severity, use your own baseline as 0.**

**Examples of what different severity ratings feel like:**

```
0/10 = Normal baseline (your usual)
1-2/10 = Barely noticeable worsening
3-4/10 = Noticeable but manageable (can do activities of daily living)
5-6/10 = Moderate crash (difficult to do normal activities)
7-8/10 = Severe (mostly bedbound, basic needs only)
9-10/10 = Worst you've ever felt (can barely do anything)
```

**Use YOUR experience, not someone else's.** A 5/10 for you might feel different than for another patient.

## Appendix B: Quick Reference - Activity Categories Cheat Sheet

```
COGNITIVE (pure brain work):
Computer, reading, puzzles, writing, learning, phone calls,
decision-making, planning, video meetings, shopping/comparing

PHYSICAL (muscle + coordination):
Walking, stairs, carrying, cooking, gardening, housework,
stretching, showering, standing, movement

EMOTIONAL (stress + autonomic):
Conflict, bad news, worry, anticipation, excitement,
frustration, social performance, medical appointments

PASSIVE (minimal demand):
TV, music, resting, routine care, eating, familiar reading,
nature watching
```

## Appendix C: Recovery Time Examples

**Reference examples (your recovery time might differ):**

```
If Cognitive PEM typical recovery is 48-72 hours:
- Day of activity: 9/10 severe
- Next morning: 8/10 still very bad
- Day 2 morning: 6-7/10 improving
- Day 3 morning: 4-5/10 almost baseline
- Day 3 evening: Back to baseline (72 hours)

If Physical PEM typical recovery is 24-36 hours:
- Day of activity: 6/10 moderate
- Next morning: 5/10
- Next evening: 3-4/10
- Day 2 morning: Back to baseline (30 hours)
```

**Your pattern might be completely different. Track what YOU actually experience.**

## Final Note: Why This Matters

**This tracking protocol does several important things:**

1. **Helps YOU manage your ME/CFS** - You'll know what activities are safest and which cause crashes.

2. **Tests a new hypothesis** - If cognitive activities really DO cause worse/longer crashes than physical activities, that's a major insight about what's broken in ME/CFS.

3. **Validates patient experience** - Often we're told "it's all in your head" or the triggers don't make sense. Structured data shows that THEY DO.

4. **Contributes to science** - Even one patient's careful data can help researchers understand ME/CFS better. And collectively, many patients' data could change how we understand and treat this disease.

5. **Empowers you** - You become a scientist of your own disease. That's powerful.

## Questions?

**If something isn't clear:**
- Start with the SIMPLE VERSION (Part 1)
- Skip sections that are too much work
- Ask your doctor or ME/CFS specialist to help with tracking
- Modify the system to work for YOU

**There is no "correct" way. There's only what works for your brain and energy level.**
