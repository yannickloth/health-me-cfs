# Scientific Insights: Wirth & Scheibenbogen (2025)

## Key Findings
1. Vagal hub gets mechanistic substrate via enterochromaffin neuropod cells
2. Two parallel tryptophan depletion pathways resolve cytokine paradox
3. Sequential gut repair then vagal stimulation as treatment strategy
4. Further integration needed in ch14i, ch14j, ch13

## Recommended Further Integration
1. Ch14i: Add mechanistic substrate for vagal hub
2. Ch14j: Expand energy theft with vagal reflex example
3. Ch11: Clarify two-pathway tryptophan model
4. Ch10: Clarify tone vs brake terminology
5. Ch13: Reference gut-serotonin-vagal-cardiovascular mechanism
