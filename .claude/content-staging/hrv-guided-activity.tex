% TARGET: ch14b treatment chapter - pacing section
% TASK: 4.3 (Sonnet) - Write HRV-guided pacing protocol
% STATUS: Placeholder - content to be developed

% Content framework:
% - Concept: Daily HRV measurement determines activity budget
% - Physiological basis: HRV reflects autonomic nervous system recovery
% - Technology: Wearable devices (chest strap or optical sensors)
% - Measurement protocol:
%   - Upon waking, before getting out of bed
%   - 3-5 minute reading
%   - Track RMSSD or HF power (parasympathetic markers)
%   - Establish personal baseline over 2 weeks
% - Activity calibration:
%   - HRV >baseline: Normal activity budget allowed
%   - HRV 80-100% baseline: Reduce activity by 20%
%   - HRV 60-80% baseline: Reduce by 40%, increase rest
%   - HRV <60% baseline: Minimal activity, active recovery day
% - Integration with planned activity
% - Devices: Polar H10, Elite HRV app, Oura ring
% - Limitations: Not validated specifically in ME/CFS
%
% Requirements:
% - Use \begin{protocol}[HRV-Guided Pacing] environment
% - Reference sports medicine / exercise physiology literature
% - Note this requires validation in ME/CFS population
%
% Target length: 700-900 words
