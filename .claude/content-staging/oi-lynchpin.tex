% TARGET: ch13-integrative-models.tex - in septad framework
% TASK: 6.1 (Sonnet) - Add OI as lynchpin insight
% STATUS: Placeholder - content to be developed

% Content framework:
% - Observation from pediatric data: OI treatment improves fatigue, cognition,
%   wellbeing (not just cardiovascular)
% - Implication: In early disease, autonomic dysfunction may be PRIMARY driver
% - Hypothesis: Other systems (immune, metabolic, neuroimmune) may be secondarily affected
% - Clinical relevance: Early aggressive OI treatment might prevent "spread" to other systems
% - Adult application: Justifies treating OI aggressively in early-stage adult patients
% - Integration with existing models: Position OI as potential upstream driver in septad
%
% Requirements:
% - Use keypoint or speculation environment (brief, ~300-500 words)
% - Cross-reference to pediatric OI data, cardiovascular chapter
% - Maintain appropriate uncertainty (hypothesis, not proven)
%
% Target length: 400-600 words
