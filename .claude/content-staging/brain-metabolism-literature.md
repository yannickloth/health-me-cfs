# Brain Metabolism and Neuroimaging Literature Review: ME/CFS

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Purpose:** Literature review of brain PET, SPECT, and fMRI studies in ME/CFS
**Focus:** Brain hypometabolism, cerebral blood flow, neuroinflammation

---

## Executive Summary

Brain neuroimaging studies in ME/CFS consistently demonstrate:

1. **Glucose hypometabolism** in multiple brain regions (PET scan evidence)
2. **Neuroinflammation** with **45-199% elevation** in key brain regions
3. **Altered cerebral blood flow** (though findings vary across studies)
4. **Abnormal brain activation patterns** during cognitive tasks (fMRI)
5. **Strong correlations** between metabolic dysfunction and symptom severity

## Key Questions Answered

### Is brain hypometabolism consistently found in ME/CFS?

**YES, with caveats:**
- Multiple independent teams replicated regional hypometabolism
- Most consistent in: brainstem, medial frontal cortex, cingulate cortex
- ~50% of patients show no metabolic abnormalities in some studies
- **Conclusion:** Consistent finding in subset, suggests disease heterogeneity

### Magnitude of Effect

**SUBSTANTIAL:**
- Neuroinflammation: 45-199% elevation (clinically significant)
- Glucose hypometabolism: "Significant" reductions
- fMRI signal complexity: Explains 40% variance in health scores
- **Effects are large enough to be clinically meaningful**

### Which Brain Regions Most Affected?

1. **Brainstem** - Most robust finding (9 studies, different modalities)
2. **Medial frontal cortex** - Hypometabolism replicated
3. **Cingulate cortex** - Both hypometabolism and neuroinflammation
4. **Limbic structures** - Amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus

**Regions governing autonomic function, executive function, pain most affected**

### Correlation with Symptom Severity

**YES, STRONG CORRELATIONS:**
- Neuroinflammation (amygdala, thalamus, midbrain) → cognitive impairment
- Neuroinflammation (cingulate, thalamus) → pain severity
- NAA elevation → worse fatigue, pain, sleep quality
- Reduced catecholamines → worse motor and cognitive symptoms

## Major Studies

### Nakatomi et al. (2014) - Landmark Neuroinflammation PET

- **Method:** ¹¹C-(R)-PK11195 PET (detects activated microglia)
- **Sample:** 9 CFS/ME patients, 10 healthy controls
- **Key findings:**
  - 45-199% higher BP_ND values in 6 brain regions
  - Cingulate, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, midbrain, pons affected
  - Symptom correlations: amygdala/thalamus → cognitive impairment

### Bragee et al. (2020) Systematic Review

- **Scope:** 63 neuroimaging studies
- **Key findings:**
  - Brainstem abnormalities: most consistent (9 studies)
  - Additional brain recruitment during cognitive tasks (11 studies)
  - Sluggish BOLD signal response

### NIH Study (2025)

- Reduced temporal-parietal junction activity
- Catecholamine deficiency in CSF
- Correlates with motor performance, cognitive symptoms

### 7T MRS Study (2024)

- Higher NAA in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
- NAA correlates with fatigue, pain, sleep quality scores

## Relevance to Selective Energy Dysfunction Hypothesis

### Strong Support for Selective Dysfunction

1. **Regional specificity** - Not global hypometabolism
2. **Task-dependent dysfunction** - Worse during cognitive demands
3. **Dissociation between perfusion and metabolism** - Primary cellular issue
4. **~50% heterogeneity** - Suggests selective vulnerability patterns

### Integration with Systemic Model

- Brain hypometabolism = CNS manifestation of selective dysfunction
- Parallels peripheral findings (muscle, immune, cardiac)
- Unifying mechanism: mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation
- Brain dysfunction both cause and consequence of systemic disease
