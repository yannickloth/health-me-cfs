% TARGET: ch14b treatment chapter - early intervention section
% TASK: 4.1 (Sonnet) - Write clinical guidance section
% STATUS: Placeholder - content to be developed

% Content framework:
% - Rationale: Pediatric advantage may partly reflect early aggressive intervention
% - Concept: "Front-load" treatment intensity in first 6-12 months
% - Protocol components:
%   - Immediate maximal OI treatment
%   - Strict pacing enforcement from diagnosis
%   - Sleep optimization (aggressive from start)
%   - Anti-inflammatory support (LDN + omega-3)
%   - Subtype-specific interventions if indicated
% - Monitoring: Monthly reassessment, biomarkers if available
% - Goal: Maximize recovery probability by treating before "hardening"
% - Evidence level: Based on pediatric insights + clinical reasoning (not RCT data yet)
%
% Requirements:
% - Use \begin{keypoint} or similar environment
% - Cross-reference to Acute Onset Protocol, Recovery Capital framework
% - Note this is informed by pediatric data but not yet proven in adults
%
% Target length: 600-800 words
