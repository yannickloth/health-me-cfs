\begin{keypoint}[The Lesson from Pediatric Recovery]
The dramatically better outcomes in pediatric ME/CFS (54--94\% recovery)
compared to adult disease ($\leq$22\%) suggest that there is a window of
opportunity for recovery that narrows over time. While we cannot make adults
into children, this observation supports three actionable principles:
(1) Treat early and aggressively---the first 1--2 years of illness may
determine long-term trajectory; (2) Prevent severe crashes---each crash
may consume irreplaceable ``recovery capital''; (3) Prioritize OI
treatment---this appears to be the most reversible component and may prevent
downstream damage to other systems. Adults newly diagnosed with ME/CFS should
be treated with the urgency we bring to pediatric cases.
