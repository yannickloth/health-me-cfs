% TARGET: ch25a-research-infrastructure.tex - Crash biomarkers section
% TASK: 5.1 (Sonnet) - Write biomarker system proposal
% STATUS: Placeholder - content to be developed

% Content framework:
% - Concept: Quantify the "damage" from crashes for objective assessment
% - Rationale: Patient reports of harm from crashes, but no objective measures
% - Proposed panel (measure before + 24h/72h post-crash):
%   1. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA): Marker of cellular damage/turnover
%   2. Inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta magnitude
%   3. Lactate:pyruvate ratio: Metabolic stress
%   4. 8-OHdG (urinary): Oxidative DNA damage
%   5. Cortisol profile: HPA axis response (24h post-crash)
%   6. NK cell cytotoxicity: Functional immune capacity change
% - Study design:
%   - Recruit patients with predictable crashes (e.g., medical appointments)
%   - Baseline sample, then post-crash samples
%   - Track cumulative biomarker changes over time
% - Clinical utility:
%   - Objective evidence of crash harm (motivate pacing)
%   - Identify accelerated Recovery Capital depletion
%   - Guide treatment intensity
%   - Track intervention effectiveness
% - Validation requirements
%
% Requirements:
% - Use research proposal or biomarker environment
% - Cross-reference to Recovery Capital framework
%
% Target length: 800-1000 words
