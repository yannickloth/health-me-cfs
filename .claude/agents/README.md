# Project-Specific Agents

Specialized subagents for this LaTeX ME/CFS documentation project.

**Routing logic and general agents are defined globally in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.** This directory contains only project-specific specialized agents.

## Lazy-Loading Principle

**Agent definitions are lazy-loaded on demand.** Each agent file contains full specifications. The router reads these to make routing decisions.

## Format

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use this agent (router reads this to decide)
model: haiku|sonnet|opus
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, ...
---

System prompt / instructions for the agent...
```

## Model Tiers

| Model | Cost | Use For |
|-------|------|---------|
| Haiku | 1x | Pattern matching, mechanical transforms |
| Sonnet | ~10x | Moderate reasoning, cross-referencing |
| Opus | ~75x | Deep reasoning, proofs, logic |

## How Delegation Works

Claude automatically delegates based on the `description` field. Include trigger phrases like:
- "Use when..."
- "Use proactively when..."

Claude matches your request to agent descriptions and spawns the appropriate subagent.

## Context Minimization

Each agent has limited tools to enforce focus:
- Read-only agents can't accidentally modify files
- Agents only receive files relevant to their task
- Use `tools:` field to restrict capabilities

## Routing Examples

**Example 1: Specialized agent exists**
- User: "The build is broken"
- Route to: `syntax-fixer` (haiku) — LaTeX build errors match this agent

**Example 2: Research task**
- User: "Add some citations for this claim about NK cells"
- Route to: `literature-integrator` (sonnet) — finding and integrating papers

**Example 3: Text quality**
- User: "This paragraph sounds robotic"
- Route to: `style-naturalizer` (sonnet) — AI-like text

**Example 4: General task, simple**
- User: "Rename all instances of `foo` to `bar` in file X"
- Route to: `haiku-general` — simple replacement, explicit file, low risk

**Example 5: General task, requires judgment**
- User: "Clean up the old files in this directory"
- Route to: `sonnet-general` — destructive, ambiguous ("old"?), no explicit paths → HIGH RISK

**Example 6: Complex reasoning**
- User: "Verify the proof in section 3.2 is correct"
- Route to: `opus-general` — mathematical verification needs deep reasoning

**Example 7: Workflow coordination**
- User: "Find papers on mitochondrial dysfunction"
- Route to: `literature-integrator` (handles full pipeline), then `chapter-integrator` for text edits

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO THIS)

**Anti-Pattern 1: Executing tasks without delegation**

❌ User: "Fix the build errors"
❌ Claude: "Let me try to fix this myself first..." *(attempts manual fixes)*
✅ Correct: Route through router → router spawns `syntax-fixer`

**Anti-Pattern 2: Skipping router for "obvious" tasks**

❌ User: "This text needs better flow"
❌ Claude: "I'll spawn style-naturalizer directly" *(bypasses router)*
✅ Correct: Route through router → router spawns `style-naturalizer`

**Anti-Pattern 3: Wrong model tier for destructive operations**

❌ User: "Delete the old implementation files"
❌ Router: "I'll use haiku-general for fast cleanup..."
✅ Correct: Destructive + ambiguous → `sonnet-general` for analysis first

**Anti-Pattern 4: Using expensive models for simple tasks**

❌ User: "Change 'colour' to 'color' throughout the file"
❌ Router: "This requires careful analysis..." → `opus-general`
✅ Correct: Simple find-replace, explicit file → `haiku-general`

**Anti-Pattern 5: Skipping specialized agents**

❌ User: "This text needs better flow"
❌ Router: Route to `sonnet-general`
✅ Correct: Text quality → `style-naturalizer` exists, use it
