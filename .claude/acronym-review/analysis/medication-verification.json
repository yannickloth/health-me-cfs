    "notes": "LDA usage is correct (1/1). LDN shows correct definition throughout but has 20 instances requiring verification of expansion. Key issues: (1) Multiple uses in ch14b-action-mild-moderate.tex between lines 498-1057 without visible expansion in context - need to verify section continuity with line 470 expansion. (2) Chapter 18 (ch18-emerging-therapies.tex) appears to lack first-use expansion - line 737 should likely expand. (3) Tables in ch18 at lines 1524-1649 need caption or first-cell expansion. (4) Appendix-i-a uses LDN at distant lines (1575, 1632, 1687) far from first expansion (line 14) - section breaks likely require re-expansion. RECOMMENDATION: Read each flagged file to verify section structure and add expansions where needed."
