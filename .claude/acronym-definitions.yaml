critical_distinctions:
  LDA:
    correct: "Low-Dose Aripiprazole (Abilify)"
    wrong: "Low-Dose Aspirin"
    verification: "Must appear near 'Aripiprazole' or 'Abilify' in context"

  LDN:
    correct: "Low-Dose Naltrexone"
    wrong: "Low-Dose Nifedipine"
    verification: "Must appear near 'Naltrexone' in context"

  CSF:
    medical: "Cerebrospinal Fluid"
    deprecated: "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (use ME/CFS instead)"
    verification: "Check context - anatomical vs diagnostic"
