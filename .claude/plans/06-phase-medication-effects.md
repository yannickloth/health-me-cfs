# Phase 6: Medication Effect Patterns (Drafts Only)

**Depends on:** Phase 2  
**Can run in parallel with:** Phases 3, 4, 5  
**Estimated:** 2 sessions  
**Models:** 1 Haiku, 10 Sonnet, 4 Opus

---

## Objective

Draft medication effect documentation for 6 effect types BUT DO NOT INTEGRATE into ch14a-d yet (deferred to Phase 7 Part 3 restructure).

**Optimization:** Prevents editing ch14a-d twice.

## 6 Effect Types

### Literature (Sonnet)
- [ ] **6.1-6.4** Literature searches for 4 effect categories (Sonnet × 4)

### Content Synthesis
- [ ] **6.5-6.8** Draft transient AEs, therapeutic lag, dose curves, withdrawal (Sonnet × 4)
- [ ] **6.9-6.10** Draft Herxheimer + energy-mood paradox (medical-advisor Opus × 2) — SAFETY CRITICAL

### Pediatric Adaptation
- [ ] **6.11-6.13** Pediatric versions (Sonnet × 2 + Haiku × 1)

### Safety Validation
- [ ] **6.14** Medical safety review | **Agent:** medical-advisor (Opus)
- [ ] **6.15** Build verification | **Agent:** test-runner (Haiku)  
- [ ] **6.16** Content review | **Agent:** content-reviewer (Sonnet)

**SKIP integration and final QA** — Deferred to Phases 7-8
