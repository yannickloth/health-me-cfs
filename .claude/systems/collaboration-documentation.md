# Collaboration Documentation System

## Purpose

This system tracks methodological decisions, collaboration patterns, and contribution types during the redaction of the ME/CFS documentation project. Data collected here will be used to document our collaboration methodology in the final paper.

## Active Session: 2026-01-23

### Initial Request
**User:** Asked Claude to create a configuration system for documenting collaboration methodology and contribution patterns.

**Rationale:** To systematically capture:
1. Types of requests made by the user
2. Claude's responses and approaches
3. Methodological decisions in the writing process
4. The nature of human-AI collaboration in academic writing

**Implementation:** Created this `collaboration-documentation.md` as a system-level configuration file.

## Contribution Categories

### User Contributions
- **Content direction:** Specifying topics, emphasis, structure
- **Domain expertise:** Medical knowledge, lived experience with ME/CFS
- **Quality control:** Reviewing outputs, requesting revisions
- **Methodological decisions:** Research approach, certainty levels, literature priorities
- **Style preferences:** Tone, audience considerations, framing

### Claude Contributions
- **Literature research:** Finding, downloading, organizing papers
- **Technical implementation:** LaTeX formatting, environment selection, build fixes
- **Synthesis:** Integrating multiple sources, identifying patterns
- **Quality assurance:** Syntax checking, consistency review, citation management
- **Structural support:** Section organization, cross-referencing, navigation

## Request Pattern Tracking

### Session Start: 2026-01-23

#### Request #1
**Type:** System Configuration
**User Request:** "add a Claude Code config [...] instructing you to note your and my contributions, especially the kind of requests I have of you for the redaction of this paper"
**Methodological Note:** User explicitly wants to document the collaboration process itself, suggesting meta-analysis of human-AI co-authorship will be part of the final paper.
**Claude Response:** Created this documentation system as a `.claude/systems/` configuration file.

## Methodological Patterns (To Be Documented)

### Research Approach
- How literature is identified and vetted
- Certainty level assignment criteria
- Integration of patient experience vs. published research

### Writing Process
- Iterative refinement patterns
- Use of specialized agents for different tasks
- Balance between automation and human oversight

### Quality Assurance
- Multi-agent review pipeline
- Build validation workflow
- Citation verification process

### Collaboration Dynamics
- Types of corrections requested
- Areas where AI excels vs. requires guidance
- Decision-making authority distribution

## Instructions for Claude

When working on this project:

1. **After completing significant requests**, append to this file:
   - Request type and brief description
   - Your approach/solution
   - Any methodological decisions made
   - Tools/agents used

2. **Note patterns in user requests:**
   - Recurring correction types
   - Domain expertise vs. technical tasks
   - Style/tone adjustments
   - Content structure changes

3. **Document methodological decisions:**
   - Literature selection criteria applied
   - Certainty level justifications
   - Environment/structure choices
   - Integration strategies

4. **Track collaboration dynamics:**
   - When you seek clarification
   - When user overrides suggestions
   - Areas requiring domain expertise input
   - Technical vs. content decisions

5. **Update regularly but non-intrusively:**
   - Don't announce updates unless asked
   - Keep entries concise and factual
   - Focus on methodology, not minutiae
   - Timestamp significant sessions

## Future Analysis

This data will support:
- Methodology section in the final paper
- Understanding human-AI collaboration in academic writing
- Identifying strengths/limitations of AI assistance in medical documentation
- Documenting the role of lived experience + AI research synthesis

---

## Notes

- This is a living document - structure may evolve
- Focus on **methodological significance**, not routine edits
- Capture decision-making processes, not just outcomes
- Document what makes this collaboration unique or effective
