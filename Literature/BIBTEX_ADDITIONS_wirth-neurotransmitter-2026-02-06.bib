% Note: "Oh et al. 2025" cited by Wirth & Scheibenbogen appears to be a general reference
% to the gut-brain axis literature rather than a specific paper. Multiple 2025 papers
% cover this topic but no specific "Oh" author was found in searches. The citations
% appear to refer to general 2025 gut-brain axis reviews.
