## Study Overview

### Design
- **Sample Size:** 61 ME/CFS patients vs. 61 age- and sex-matched healthy controls
- **Location:** Australia
- **Approach:** Multi-modal analysis integrating three biological systems

### Methodology
Multi-omics approach combining:
1. **Energy metabolism** analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
2. **Immune cell composition** profiling via flow cytometry
3. **Plasma proteomics** analysis

## Key Findings

### Energy Metabolism (in immune cells)
| Metabolite | Finding in ME/CFS |
|------------|-------------------|
| AMP | Elevated |
| ADP | Elevated |
| ATP/ADP ratio | Reduced (indicating decreased ATP generation) |
| NAD+ | Elevated |
| NADP/NADPH ratio | Elevated (oxidative stress marker) |

### Immune Cell Abnormalities
| Cell Type | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| CD56lowCD16+ NK cells | Reduced (virus-fighting subset) |
| CD1c+CD141- cDC2 | Reduced (conventional dendritic cells type 2) |
| CD27+CD28+ T cells | Increased (early memory subset) |
| Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) | Increased proportion |
| IFN-gamma, TNF, IL-12/IL-18 | Reduced production |

### Vascular Markers (Plasma Proteomics)
Elevated levels of proteins associated with:
- Thrombus formation
- Vascular reactivity
- Endothelial dysfunction

## 7-Biomarker Diagnostic Model

### CART Model Performance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUC | 0.962 |
| Sensitivity | 85.2% |
| Specificity | 96.7% |
| Overall Accuracy | 91.6% |

### Biomarker Panel
1. **AMP** - Adenosine monophosphate (energy stress marker)
2. **cDC1** - Conventional dendritic cells type 1
3. **LYVE1** - Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1
4. **IGHG2** - Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 2
5. **FN1** - Fibronectin 1
6. **VWF** - Von Willebrand factor (coagulation/vascular)
7. **THBS1** - Thrombospondin 1 (angiogenesis regulator)

2. Scroll to "Supplemental Information" section at bottom of article
3. Download individual supplementary files (Tables S1-Sn, Figures S1-Sn)

## Significance for ME/CFS Research

This study is significant because it:

1. **Demonstrates coordinated multi-system dysfunction** - energy, immune, and vascular systems are simultaneously affected
2. **Provides diagnostic biomarker candidates** with excellent discriminatory power (AUC 0.962)
3. **Measures energy metabolism directly in immune cells** rather than plasma, capturing cellular-level dysfunction
4. **Supports the Vascular-Immune-Energy Triad hypothesis** for ME/CFS pathophysiology
5. **Identifies specific targetable pathways** for therapeutic development
