\begin{achievement}[Shared Exercise Pathophysiology in ME/CFS and Long COVID]
\label{ach:joseph2023-exercise}
Joseph et al.~\cite{Joseph2023} demonstrated substantial overlap in exercise
pathophysiology between ME/CFS and Long COVID (PASC). Cardiopulmonary exercise
testing reveals perturbations in systemic blood flow and ventilatory control
that are not typical of simple deconditioning. Hemodynamic and gas exchange
derangements in PASC overlap with those in ME/CFS, suggesting shared mechanisms.
Study: (comprehensive review, CHEST journal, Harvard/Yale authors, certainty: High).
This validates ME/CFS exercise intolerance as physiological, not deconditioning.
\end{achievement}
```

### Secondary Target: ch23-epidemiology-outcomes.tex
**File:** `contents/part4-research/ch23-epidemiology-outcomes.tex`
**Section hint:** "Long COVID" or "Post-viral sequelae"
**Suggested inline citation:**
```latex
The substantial overlap in exercise pathophysiology between ME/CFS and Long COVID,
including shared hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities~\cite{Joseph2023},
suggests that insights from ME/CFS research may inform Long COVID treatment and
vice versa.
```

## Key Points to Convey

1. **Not deconditioning** - CPET abnormalities distinct from simple detraining
2. **Shared mechanisms** - ME/CFS and Long COVID show same pathophysiological patterns
3. **Hemodynamic dysfunction** - systemic blood flow problems, not just muscle weakness
4. **Ventilatory control abnormalities** - respiratory regulation impaired
5. **Validates ME/CFS** - Long COVID research validates decades of ME/CFS findings

## Certainty Assessment for Integration

- **Quality:** High (comprehensive review, CHEST journal, Harvard/Yale authors)
- **Sample:** Review of multiple studies
- **Replication:** Consistent findings across ME/CFS and PASC studies
- **Limitations:** Review (not primary data); Long COVID heterogeneous population
