**PMID:** 35172863
**Type:** Prospective observational study

## Summary

This study used standardized 10-minute passive vertical lean testing with capnography to assess orthostatic intolerance in 63 ME/CFS patients across multiple visits. The key finding: 60.3% of patients demonstrated objective abnormalities, with hypocapnia (low end-tidal CO2) detected in 85.2% of abnormal tests - far exceeding POTS (25%) and orthostatic hypotension (16%).

Critically, hypocapnia did not correlate with anxiety scores, refuting the psychiatric interpretation of hyperventilation syndrome.

## Clinical Significance

- **Diagnostic:** Capnography essential - hypocapnia missed by standard vital signs
- **Prevalence:** Majority of ME/CFS patients have measurable orthostatic dysfunction
- **Treatment:** POTS protocols alone insufficient; CO2/breathing management needed
- **Pathophysiology:** Suggests respiratory/brainstem dysregulation
- **Accessibility:** 10-min lean test simpler than full tilt table

## Key Finding

**Hypocapnia dominates orthostatic abnormalities:**
- 85.2% of abnormal tests (58/68)
- Detected after orthostatic challenge (44 instances) or at rest (14 additional)
- More common and more persistent than POTS

## Limitations

- No healthy control group
- Single-center study
- Moderate sample (n=63)
- Mechanism unclear
- Needs replication
