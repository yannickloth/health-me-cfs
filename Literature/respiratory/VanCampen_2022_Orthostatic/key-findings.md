# Key Findings: Orthostatic Hypocapnia in ME/CFS

## Main Findings

1. **High Prevalence:** 60.3% of ME/CFS patients show objective orthostatic abnormalities on standardized testing

2. **Hypocapnia Dominance:** 85.2% of abnormal tests detected hypocapnia (low end-tidal CO2), making it the most common orthostatic abnormality - far exceeding POTS (25%)

3. **Not Anxiety-Related:** Anxiety scores did not correlate with hypocapnia presence, refuting psychiatric interpretation

4. **Diagnostic Gap:** Hypocapnia would be missed without capnography - standard orthostatic testing (HR, BP only) insufficient

## Clinical Implications

- Capnography should be standard equipment for ME/CFS orthostatic assessment
- POTS-focused treatment protocols miss majority of patients
- Breathing retraining and CO2 management may help
- Hypocapnia may contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion (CO2 is vasodilator)
- Simple 10-minute lean test may be more accessible than full tilt table for severe patients

## Limitations

- No healthy control group for comparison
- Single-center study
- Moderate sample size (n=63)
- Needs multicenter replication
- Unknown mechanism of hypocapnia (respiratory drive? chemoreceptor dysfunction?)

## Integration Points

### Chapter 3: Additional Symptoms (Orthostatic Intolerance)
- Could support: Prevalence and types of orthostatic abnormalities
- Cites as: **achievement** (standardized methodology, clinically significant)

### Chapter 8: Neurological
- Could support: Brainstem/respiratory control dysfunction
- Cites as: **observation** (suggests mechanism)

### Chapter 14: Symptom Management
- Could support: Orthostatic intolerance treatment approaches
- Cites as: **achievement** (informs treatment selection)
