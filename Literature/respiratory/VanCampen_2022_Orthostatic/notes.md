**DOI:** 10.1186/s12967-022-03289-8

## Key Points

- 60.3% of ME/CFS patients show orthostatic abnormalities on standardized testing
- Hypocapnia (low CO2) is most common finding (85.2% of abnormal tests)
- POTS detected in only 25% of abnormal tests - less common than hypocapnia
- Hypocapnia NOT associated with anxiety - challenges conventional medical teaching
- Capnography essential - hypocapnia would be missed with standard vital signs alone

## Methodology

**Study Design:**
- Prospective observational study
- 63 ME/CFS patients
- Multiple visits (3 visits analyzed)
- Standardized 10-minute passive vertical lean test

**Measurements:**
- Heart rate
- Blood pressure
- Respiratory rate
- End-tidal CO2 (eTCO2) via capnography

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- POTS: HR increase ≥30 bpm (or ≥40 bpm for teens)
- Orthostatic hypotension: SBP drop ≥20 mmHg or DBP drop ≥10 mmHg
- Hypocapnia: eTCO2 <32 mmHg

## Results Summary

**Abnormality Prevalence:**
- 60.3% (38/63) had abnormality at any visit
- 51%, 50%, 45% at visits 1, 2, 3 (consistent across time)

**Hypocapnia Dominance:**
- 58 of 68 abnormal tests (85.2%) detected hypocapnia
- 44 instances: hypocapnia after orthostatic challenge
- 14 instances: hypocapnia also while supine (resting)
- Most frequent and most persistent abnormality

**Other Findings:**
- POTS: 25% of abnormal tests (17/68)
- Orthostatic hypotension: 16.1% of abnormal tests (11/68)

**Anxiety Relationship:**
- NO correlation between hypocapnia and anxiety scores
- Challenges conventional teaching that hypocapnia indicates anxiety/hyperventilation syndrome

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

**Diagnostic Implications:**
- Standard tilt table testing may miss most abnormalities (focused on POTS/OH)
- Capnography should be standard in ME/CFS orthostatic assessment
- Hypocapnia more common than POTS in this population

**Pathophysiology:**
- Hypocapnia suggests respiratory dysregulation
- Not anxiety-driven (anxiety scores didn't correlate)
- May reflect brainstem/autonomic dysfunction
- Could relate to cerebral hypoperfusion (low CO2 causes vasoconstriction)

**Clinical Management:**
- Breathing exercises/CO2 rebreathing may help some patients
- POTS treatments alone insufficient for many patients
- Need multimodal assessment of orthostatic intolerance

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (prospective, standardized protocol, peer-reviewed)
- **Sample Size:** Moderate (n=63 ME/CFS patients)
- **Replication:** Single study, awaiting independent confirmation
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not mentioned
- **Limitations:** No healthy control group for comparison; single-center study
