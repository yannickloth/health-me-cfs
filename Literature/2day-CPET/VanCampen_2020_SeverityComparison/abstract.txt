ABSTRACT:

This study examined 82 female ME/CFS patients across three severity groups (31 mild, 31 moderate, 20 severe) using a two-day cardiopulmonary exercise testing protocol. Researchers measured oxygen consumption, heart rate, and workload parameters.

All analyzed CPET parameters (peak VO2, VO2 at VT, peak workload and the workload at VT) decreased significantly from day-1 to day-2 within each severity group.

The severe group demonstrated the largest decline in peak workload (-19%), suggesting disease severity negatively impacts exercise recovery.

The research confirms that a two-day testing protocol effectively discriminates ME/CFS severity levels, with severe patients showing pronounced post-exertional deterioration compared to milder cases.
