## Overview

Compares 2-day CPET results across ME/CFS severity levels (mild, moderate, severe), demonstrating that crash severity correlates with baseline disease severity.

## Key Contribution

**Severity-stratified dose-response evidence:**
- All severity groups showed significant Day 1→Day 2 declines (universal PEM)
- Severe ME/CFS: Largest decline (peak workload -19%)
- Moderate: Intermediate decline
- Mild: Smallest decline (but still significant)
- **Implication:** Same exertion produces different crash severity based on baseline state

## Evidence Grade: A

- Good sample size (n=82: 31 mild, 31 moderate, 20 severe)
- Objective measures
- Clear severity stratification
- Peer-reviewed publication
- Female-only cohort (limits generalizability to males)

## Files

- `abstract.txt` - Full abstract from PubMed/PMC
- `notes.md` - Detailed analysis of severity-dependent patterns
- `key-findings.md` - Clinical implications for stratified pacing guidance
- `integration-guide.md` - LaTeX integration for heterogeneity within "mild-moderate"

## Relevance to Document

**Primary integration target:** Chapter 14b (Mild-Moderate Action Plans)

**Critical for Chapter 14b because:**
- "Mild-moderate" is not homogeneous - there's a spectrum
- Crash severity varies with baseline severity even for similar exertion
- Pacing recommendations must acknowledge within-category heterogeneity
- Supports individual assessment (VT measurement) over one-size-fits-all advice

**Secondary target:** Chapter 13 (Severity Classification) - 2-day CPET as objective severity grading tool
