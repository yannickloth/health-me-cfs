# Key Findings: Two-Day CPET Meta-Analysis

## Main Findings

1. **Objective PEM Measurement:** Workload@VT (ventilatory threshold work capacity) provides statistically significant discrimination between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls on second-day testing (p=0.01)

2. **Opposite Performance Trajectories:** ME/CFS patients decline -14.6 Watts on day 2 while healthy controls improve +6.5 Watts - a unique pathophysiological pattern

3. **Diagnostic Specificity:** This decline-vs-recovery pattern distinguishes ME/CFS from other fatiguing conditions (MS, cardiac/pulmonary disease) which show stable or improved repeat performance

4. **Meta-Analysis Strength:** Findings replicated across 5 independent studies with 98 ME/CFS patients

## Clinical Implications

- Provides objective biomarker for PEM, the hallmark ME/CFS symptom
- Can be used to validate diagnosis when patient history is unclear
- Demonstrates functional impairment in measurable physiological terms
- Supports disability claims with objective evidence

## Limitations

- Relatively small total sample (n=98 patients across 5 studies)
- Predominantly female cohort (90F:8M) - generalizability to males unclear
- Individual study sizes small
- Requires specialized CPET equipment and trained personnel
- Two-day protocol may be contraindicated for severe patients

## Integration Points

### Chapter 2: Core Symptoms (PEM section)
- Could support: Objective measurement of post-exertional malaise
- Cites as: **achievement** (meta-analysis, replicated, high certainty)

### Chapter 22: Mechanistic Studies
- Could support: Exercise pathophysiology research methods
- Cites as: **achievement** (validated diagnostic method)
