## Summary

This meta-analysis examined whether two-day cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) could objectively measure post-exertional malaise (PEM), the hallmark symptom of ME/CFS. Pooling data from 5 studies with 98 ME/CFS patients and 51 healthy controls, the authors found that workload at ventilatory threshold (Workload@VT) showed the most significant discrimination between groups.

**Key Finding:** ME/CFS patients declined by an average of 14.6 Watts on the second test day, while healthy controls improved by 6.5 Watts (p=0.01). This opposite performance trajectory distinguishes ME/CFS from other fatiguing conditions and provides objective validation of patient-reported exercise intolerance.

## Clinical Significance

- **Diagnostic utility:** Provides objective, reproducible measure of PEM
- **Differential diagnosis:** Pattern distinguishes ME/CFS from deconditioning, MS, cardiac/pulmonary disease
- **Validation:** Confirms patient reports of exercise intolerance with measurable physiology
- **Disability support:** Objective evidence for disability claims

## Limitations

- Relatively small sample sizes in individual studies
- Predominantly female cohort (90F:8M)
- Two-day CPET protocol may be contraindicated for severe patients
- Requires specialized equipment and expertise
