# The Prospects of Two-Day CPET in ME/CFS: Meta-Analysis

**Citation:** Lim EJ, Kang EB, Jang ES, Son CG. The Prospects of the Two-Day Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) in ME/CFS Patients: A Meta-Analysis. *J Clin Med.* 2020;9(12):4040. doi:10.3390/jcm9124040

**PMID:** 33327624

## Key Findings

**Meta-Analysis of 5 Studies:**
- 98 ME/CFS patients (90 female, 8 male)
- 51 healthy controls
- Standardized cycling protocols, 24-hour separation

**Most Significant Finding:**
- **Workload at ventilatory threshold (VT):** ME/CFS declined −14.6 watts from test 1 to test 2; controls improved +6.5 watts
- Difference highly significant (p < 0.05)
- "Most notable significant difference" demonstrating functional impairment

**Other Metrics:**
- VO2peak: ME/CFS −1.4 vs. controls +0.3 (not statistically significant)
- VO2@VT and Workloadpeak: Similar patterns but less pronounced

## Clinical Implications

- **Objective PEM measurement:** Workload@VT most sensitive metric for 2-day CPET
- **Ventilatory threshold critical:** Marks aerobic-anaerobic transition; greater decline in ME/CFS
- **Complements individual studies:** Pooled analysis strengthens evidence
- **Diagnostic potential:** Standardized 2-day CPET protocol can objectively demonstrate impaired recovery

## Comparison with Keller 2024

| Study | Sample | Key Finding |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Lim 2020 meta-analysis | n=149 pooled | Workload@VT: −14.6W (ME/CFS) vs. +6.5W (controls) |
| Keller 2024 | n=155 | All CPET parameters declined Day 2 (VO2peak, work, VE, HR, O2 pulse) |

**Consistency:** Both demonstrate impaired Day 2 recovery; Keller 2024 larger sample with more comprehensive metrics.

## Integration Points

**Chapter: Post-Exertional Malaise**
- Meta-analytic evidence for objective PEM measurement
- Use `observation` environment (pooled data, significant result)

**Chapter: Diagnostic Biomarkers**
- 2-day CPET as functional diagnostic test
- Cross-reference Keller 2024
- Use `observation` for established finding

**Appendix: Diagnostic Methods**
- Describe 2-day CPET protocol standardization
- Workload@VT as most sensitive metric
- Use `observation` + `recommendation` for clinical application

**Certainty:** High (meta-analysis of multiple studies, consistent finding, replicated in Keller 2024)
