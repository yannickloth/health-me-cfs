**Authors:** Eun-Jin Lim, Eun-Bum Kang, Eun-Su Jang, Chang-Gue Son
**Journal:** Journal of Clinical Medicine, 2020, 9(12):4040
**DOI:** 10.3390/jcm9124040

## Key Points

- First meta-analysis examining two-day CPET as objective measure of post-exertional malaise (PEM)
- Combined 5 studies (98 ME/CFS patients, 51 healthy controls)
- Workload@VT emerged as most discriminatory parameter
- ME/CFS patients decline on day 2 while controls improve - unique pattern

## Methodology

**Meta-Analysis Design:**
- 5 studies included (n=98 ME/CFS, n=51 HC)
- Predominantly female (90 F, 8 M in patient group)
- Mean age ~41-42 years
- Four parameters evaluated: VO2peak, Workloadpeak, VO2@VT, Workload@VT

**Statistical Approach:**
- Compared Test 2 - Test 1 differences between groups
- 24-hour interval between tests

## Results Summary

**Primary Finding:**
Workload@VT showed statistically significant group difference (p=0.01):
- ME/CFS: -14.6 Watts decline on day 2
- Healthy controls: +6.5 Watts improvement on day 2

**Secondary Parameters:**
- VO2peak: -1.4 mL/kg/min (patients) vs +0.3 (controls), p=0.23
- Workloadpeak: -6.5 W (patients) vs +4.0 W (controls), p=0.83
- VO2@VT: -1.1 mL/kg/min (patients) vs +1.3 (controls), p=0.10

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

**Diagnostic Utility:**
Provides objective, reproducible measure of PEM - the hallmark symptom of ME/CFS that distinguishes it from other fatiguing conditions.

**Clinical Significance:**
- Pattern distinguishes ME/CFS from MS, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease
- Ventilatory threshold work capacity most sensitive marker
- Validates patient reports of exercise intolerance

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (systematic review/meta-analysis, peer-reviewed)
- **Sample Size:** Moderate (n=98 patients, n=51 controls)
- **Replication:** Meta-analysis of 5 independent studies
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not mentioned in abstract
- **Limitations:** Predominantly female cohort, relatively small individual study sizes

> "Workload@VT emerged as the most discriminatory parameter...may reflect the functional impairment associated with PEM."

> "The pattern—ME/CFS patients failing to reproduce work capacity while controls recovered—distinguished ME/CFS from other fatiguing conditions like multiple sclerosis and cardiac/pulmonary diseases."
