**Publication Date:** July 5, 2024

## Key Points

- **Largest 2-day CPET study in ME/CFS to date:** n=84 ME/CFS patients, n=71 sedentary controls
- **Multi-site data collection:** 2018-2022, enhancing generalizability
- **Canadian Criteria:** Used stringent diagnostic criteria
- **24-hour interval:** Tests separated by exactly 24 hours to capture PEM effects

## Primary Findings

### ME/CFS patients showed significant declines from Day 1 to Day 2 in:

**At Peak Exertion:**
- Work capacity
- Exercise time
- Oxygen consumption (VO2)
- Oxygen pulse (VO2/HR - indicator of stroke volume)
- Ventilation

**At Ventilatory Threshold (Anaerobic Threshold):**
- Work capacity
- Oxygen consumption
- Oxygen pulse

**Symptom Changes:**
- Symptoms worsened significantly 24 hours after CPET-1

### Controls showed opposite pattern:
- Maintained or improved performance on Day 2
- No significant symptom worsening

## Methodology

- Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on cycle ergometer
- Two maximal tests separated by 24 hours
- Multiple physiological parameters measured:
  - VO2 (oxygen consumption)
  - Heart rate
  - Work (watts)
  - Ventilation
  - Oxygen pulse (stroke volume indicator)
  - Ventilatory threshold
- Symptom assessments pre- and post-exercise

## Acronym Definitions

- PEM: Post-Exertional Malaise
- ME/CFS: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
- CPET: Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test
- VO2: Oxygen consumption (volume of O2)
- VT: Ventilatory Threshold (anaerobic threshold)
- HR: Heart Rate

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Very High
  - Largest 2-day CPET study in ME/CFS
  - Multi-site recruitment (reduces single-center bias)
  - Rigorous diagnostic criteria (Canadian Criteria)
  - Objective physiological measures
  - Appropriate control group (sedentary)
- **Sample Size:** n=84 ME/CFS, n=71 controls (excellent for this type of study)
- **Replication:** Replicates and extends prior smaller 2-day CPET studies
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None apparent (academic research, multiple institutions)
- **Limitations:**
  - Cycle ergometer may not capture all forms of exertion (e.g., orthostatic stress)
  - 24-hour interval may miss delayed PEM in some patients
  - Sedentary controls (not matched for pre-illness fitness)

## Clinical Implications

1. **Objective PEM Biomarker:** Provides objective, reproducible measure of PEM - the failure to reproduce exercise capacity on Day 2

2. **Autonomic Dysfunction Evidence:** Reduced oxygen pulse suggests impaired stroke volume, pointing to autonomic/cardiovascular dysfunction

3. **Dose-Response Relationship:** Demonstrates clear relationship between exertion intensity and physiological impairment 24 hours later

4. **Activity Pacing Support:** Provides physiological basis for recommending activity below ventilatory threshold

5. **Disability Documentation:** Offers objective measure for documenting functional impairment

6. **Treatment Considerations:** Authors suggest targeting autonomic dysfunction and oxygen delivery

## Mechanistic Insights

- **Oxygen delivery impairment:** Reduced VO2 and oxygen pulse suggest cardiovascular/autonomic dysfunction
- **Not deconditioning:** Sedentary controls maintained performance, ruling out simple deconditioning explanation
- **Threshold phenomenon:** Impairment affects both peak and sub-maximal (VT) performance
- **Reproducible dysfunction:** Pattern consistent across 84 patients at multiple sites
