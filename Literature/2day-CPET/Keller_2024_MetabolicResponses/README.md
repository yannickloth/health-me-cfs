## Overview

**Largest and most comprehensive 2-day CPET study in ME/CFS to date.** Multi-site study (2018-2022) with 84 ME/CFS patients and 71 sedentary controls, demonstrating objective post-exertional impairment across multiple cardiopulmonary parameters.

## Key Contribution

**Gold standard objective evidence for PEM dose-response:**
- ME/CFS patients showed significant declines 24h post-exertion in work capacity, VO2, oxygen pulse, and ventilatory threshold
- Controls maintained or improved performance on Day 2
- Reduced oxygen pulse suggests autonomic/cardiovascular dysfunction
- Provides physiological basis for ventilatory threshold as pacing target

## Evidence Grade: A+

**Highest quality evidence for PEM:**
- Largest sample size (n=84 ME/CFS, n=71 controls)
- Multi-site recruitment
- Objective physiological measures
- Recent publication (2024)
- Rigorous diagnostic criteria (Canadian Criteria)

## Files

- `abstract.txt` - Full abstract from PubMed
- `notes.md` - Comprehensive summary with methodology and mechanistic insights
- `key-findings.md` - Clinical implications for crash severity classification
- `integration-guide.md` - Multiple LaTeX integration targets across chapters

## Relevance to Document

**Primary integration targets:**
1. **Chapter 14b:** Crash dose-response relationship and activity thresholds
2. **Chapter 6 (Pathophysiology):** PEM mechanisms (autonomic/cardiovascular dysfunction)
3. **Chapter 13 (Severity Classification):** Objective functional assessment
4. **Chapter 15 (Pacing):** Ventilatory threshold as physiological activity limit

This is the landmark study for objective PEM measurement and should be cited extensively.
