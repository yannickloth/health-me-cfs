Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex chronic disease with limited therapeutic options. This study examines prognostic factors for recovery and improvement in ME/CFS patients.

Methods: Retrospective longitudinal study of 168 adult ME/CFS patients from 2011-2020. Assessments used validated fatigue scales (FSS, FS, MFIS). Recovery defined as >50% FSS reduction; improvement as 30-50% reduction. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed predictive factors.

Results: Recovery and improvement rates were 8.3% and 4.8%, respectively, over median follow-up of 55 months. Diagnostic delay was inversely associated with recovery/improvement (OR 0.98, p=0.036). Recovered/improved patients had median diagnostic delay of 23 months versus 55 months for others (p=0.0004). Older age at disease onset was associated with recovery/improvement (OR 1.06, p=0.028).

Conclusions: Early diagnosis significantly improves prognosis. Diagnostic delay is a critical modifiable factor affecting ME/CFS outcomes. Results provide hope for improvement even at advanced age with appropriate pacing strategies.
