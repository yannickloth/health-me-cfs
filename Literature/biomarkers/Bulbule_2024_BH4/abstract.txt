BACKGROUND: Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and its oxidized derivative dihydrobiopterin (BH2) were found to be strongly elevated in ME/CFS patients with orthostatic intolerance (ME + OI). However, the molecular mechanism of biopterin biogenesis is poorly understood in ME + OI subjects.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elucidate the biogenesis of biopterins and their impact on the immune system.

DESIGN: Pilot mechanistic study using patient samples and cellular assays.

METHODS: Plasma samples from ME/CFS patients with orthostatic intolerance (ME + OI, n=10) and healthy controls (HC, n=10) were analyzed. BH4 and BH2 levels were measured by competitive ELISA. The level of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH1 or GCH1) enzyme was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolites were measured. In vitro experiments used human microglial cells.

RESULTS: BH4 and BH2 levels were significantly elevated in ME + OI patients. The activation of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was confirmed to be required for the upregulation of both BH4 and BH2 via the purine biosynthetic pathway. Exogenously added plasma samples of ME + OI patients with high BH4 upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) in human microglial cells, suggesting these biopterins could stimulate inflammatory responses in ME + OI patients.

CONCLUSIONS: The augmentation of anaerobic PPP plays a critical role in the biogenesis of biopterins in ME/CFS patients with orthostatic intolerance. Elevated BH4 may contribute to neuroinflammation through iNOS/NO pathway activation.

- Showed elevated BH4 in CFS (n=32), CFS+OI (n=10), CFS+OI+SFN (n=12) vs controls (n=30)
- BH4 significantly elevated in all CFS groups (p=0.033 for general CFS, p=0.0223 for CFS+OI)
