ABSTRACT:
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease with no confirmed diagnostic biomarker. We investigated immune signatures in ME/CFS using multiplex immunoassays for 51 cytokines/chemokines in plasma samples from 298 ME/CFS patients and 348 healthy controls. We found distinct immune differences depending on disease duration. Early ME/CFS cases (illness duration <3 years, n=52) showed prominent activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, with elevated levels of IL-1α, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-17F, IFN-γ, CXCL1, CXCL9, and IL-5. In contrast, patients with longer disease duration (>3 years, n=246) had cytokine profiles that normalized or showed no significant differences from controls. The findings suggest a transition from initial immune activation to exhaustion or adaptation over time. Importantly, we identified a signature of 17 cytokines that could distinguish early ME/CFS from controls, providing evidence for immune-based biomarkers. The correlation with illness duration rather than severity suggests that ME/CFS immunopathology evolves over time.
