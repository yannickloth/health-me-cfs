# Hornig et al., 2015: Cytokine Signatures in ME/CFS

## Paper Summary

This landmark study published in *Science Advances* identified distinct cytokine signatures in ME/CFS that vary by disease duration. The research analyzed 51 cytokines/chemokines in 298 ME/CFS patients and 348 healthy controls, revealing a striking pattern: early-stage patients (<3 years) show pronounced immune activation with elevated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, while late-stage patients (>3 years) have normalized cytokine levels.

## Why This Paper Matters

1. **First large-scale evidence for time-dependent immune evolution in ME/CFS**
2. **Identifies potential diagnostic biomarker panel (17 cytokines) for early disease**
3. **Explains heterogeneity in previous cytokine studies (failure to stratify by duration)**
4. **Suggests therapeutic windows: early intervention may be more effective**
5. **Published in prestigious journal (Science Advances), high credibility**

**Sample:** n=298 ME/CFS (52 early, 246 late), n=348 controls

**Key Result:** 17-cytokine panel distinguishes early ME/CFS from controls; cytokines normalize after 3 years

**Certainty:** High (large sample, prestigious journal, partially replicated)
