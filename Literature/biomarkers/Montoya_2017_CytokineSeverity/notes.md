**DOI:** 10.1073/pnas.1710519114

**PMID:** 28760971

## Key Points

- **First large study demonstrating dose-response relationship between cytokines and symptom severity**
- 17 cytokines correlated with disease severity on a continuous scale
- 13 of 17 severity-correlated cytokines are proinflammatory
- Provides evidence that immune activation tracks with symptom burden
- Complements Hornig 2015 by focusing on severity rather than duration

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Cross-sectional case-control study with severity stratification

**Sample Size:**
- ME/CFS patients: n=192
- Healthy controls: n=392
- Total: n=584

**Severity Assessment:**
- Patients classified using standard clinical assessments
- Severity measured on continuous scale
- Stratified into mild, moderate, and severe groups

**Methods:**
- 51-cytokine multiplex immunoassay using Luminex technology
- Plasma samples
- Linear regression models testing cytokine-severity correlations
- False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons

## Results Summary

### Overall Patient vs. Control Differences:
- **TGF-β:** Higher in patients (p<0.05)
- **Resistin:** Lower in patients (p<0.05)
- Surprisingly few cytokines differentiated patients from controls overall

### 17 Cytokines Correlating with Severity (Upward Trend):

**Proinflammatory cytokines (13/17):**
1. CCL11 (Eotaxin-1) - eosinophil chemoattractant
2. CXCL1 (GRO-α) - neutrophil chemoattractant
3. CXCL10 (IP-10) - T cell chemoattractant
4. IFN-γ - Th1 cytokine, antiviral
5. IL-4 - Th2 cytokine
6. IL-5 - eosinophil activator
7. IL-7 - lymphocyte survival
8. IL-12p70 - Th1 polarization
9. IL-13 - Th2 cytokine
10. IL-17F - Th17 cytokine
11. G-CSF - granulocyte growth factor
12. GM-CSF - myeloid cell growth factor
13. TGF-α - epithelial growth factor

**Growth factors and metabolic regulators (4/17):**
14. Leptin - adipokine, metabolic regulator
15. LIF - leukemia inhibitory factor
16. NGF - nerve growth factor
17. SCF - stem cell factor

### Cytokine with Inverse Correlation:
- **CXCL9 (MIG):** Inversely correlated with fatigue duration (p<0.05)
  - Higher levels in early disease, lower in chronic disease
  - Consistent with Hornig 2015 duration-dependent pattern

## Key Insight: Severity vs. Duration

**Montoya 2017 (severity):**
- 17 cytokines correlate with symptom severity
- Proinflammatory pattern dominant

**Hornig 2015 (duration):**
- Early disease shows high cytokines
- Late disease shows normalized cytokines

**Integration:**
Both duration AND severity matter:
- Early + severe = highest cytokines
- Early + mild = moderate cytokines
- Late disease = low cytokines regardless of severity (?)

**Implication:** Severe patients may maintain immune activation longer, OR severity reflects current immune activation level independent of duration.

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

### Chapter 7 (Immune Dysfunction - Cytokines):
- Provides evidence for cytokine-symptom correlation
- Demonstrates dose-response relationship (stronger evidence than binary comparison)
- Identifies specific cytokines relevant to symptom severity

### Diagnostic and Prognostic Use:
- Cytokine profiling may predict severity
- Could stratify patients for clinical trials
- May identify patients likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High
  - Published in PNAS (prestigious, high-impact journal)
  - Large sample size (n=584 total)
  - Rigorous methodology with Luminex multiplex assays
  - Appropriate statistical corrections (FDR)
  - Strong institutional affiliations (Stanford University)

- **Sample Size:** Large (n=192 patients adequately powered for correlational analysis)

- **Replication:** Partially replicated
  - Che 2025 (NPJ Metabolic Health Dis) confirmed cytokine elevation in severe patients
  - Multiple smaller studies confirm cytokine-severity associations
  - Specific cytokine panel not independently validated

- **Conflicts of Interest:** None declared

## Limitations

1. **Cross-sectional design:** Cannot determine if cytokines cause symptoms or result from them
2. **Diagnosis criteria:** Fukuda 1994 (less stringent)
3. **Few overall differences from controls:** Only 2/51 cytokines differed between all patients and controls
   - Suggests heterogeneity: severe patients drive most of the signal
   - Mild patients may have near-normal cytokine profiles
4. **Severity assessment:** Subjective clinical assessment rather than objective functional measures
5. **Duration not fully explored:** CXCL9 inverse correlation hints at duration effects but not systematically analyzed
6. **Plasma vs. tissue:** Peripheral cytokines may not reflect CNS or tissue-level inflammation

## Quotes for Citation

> "Seventeen cytokines displayed a statistically significant upward linear trend that correlated with disease severity, and 13 of these 17 cytokines are proinflammatory."

> "These results are consistent with immune system involvement in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS and suggest that inflammatory processes increase with disease severity."

> "The clear association between proinflammatory cytokines and ME/CFS severity suggests that these patients may benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies."

## Integration with Other Key Studies

**Hornig 2015 + Montoya 2017 + Che 2025:**
- Hornig: Duration-dependent (early high, late low)
- Montoya: Severity-dependent (mild low, severe high)
- Che 2025: Sex-dependent (women >45 especially high, estradiol effect)

**Combined model:**
ME/CFS cytokine profiles are determined by:
1. Disease duration (early > late)
2. Disease severity (severe > mild)
3. Sex and hormones (women > men, low estradiol = higher)

**Clinical application:**
- Early + severe + female + low estradiol = highest cytokines → most likely to benefit from immunomodulation
- Late + mild + male = lowest cytokines → may require different therapeutic approach
