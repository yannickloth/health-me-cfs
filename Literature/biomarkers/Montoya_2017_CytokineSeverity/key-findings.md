# Key Findings: Montoya et al., 2017 - Cytokine-Severity Correlation

## Main Findings

1. **17 cytokines correlate with ME/CFS severity** in dose-response fashion (13/17 proinflammatory)
2. **Minimal overall patient-control differences** (only 2/51 cytokines: TGF-β ↑, resistin ↓)
3. **Severity-correlated cytokines:** CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL10, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17F, leptin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF, NGF, SCF, TGF-α
4. **CXCL9 inversely correlated with duration** (high early, low late) - consistent with Hornig 2015

## Clinical Implications

- Cytokine profiling can stratify patients by severity
- Severe patients show proinflammatory signature → may benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies
- Mild patients have near-normal cytokines → may need different treatment approach

## Integration Points

### Chapter 7: Immune Dysfunction (§7.4 Cytokines)
- Expand section 7.4.3 (Pro-inflammatory Cytokines) with Montoya 2017 findings
- Add \begin{achievement}[Cytokine-Severity Biomarker Panel] for the 17-cytokine signature
- Note dose-response relationship as stronger evidence than binary comparison

### Certainty: High
- n=584 (192 patients, 392 controls)
- Published in PNAS
- Partially replicated (Che 2025)
