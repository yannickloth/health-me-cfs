# Giloteaux et al., 2023: IL-2 in Extracellular Vesicles

## Paper Summary

Study of cytokine content in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma, finding significantly elevated IL-2 in ME/CFS patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (CSF2, TNFα) correlated with physical and fatigue symptoms.

## Key Findings

1. **IL-2 significantly elevated** in ME/CFS patient EVs vs. controls
2. **CSF2 and TNFα correlate with symptoms:** Greater levels = worse physical function and fatigue
3. **EV-based analysis:** Novel approach examining vesicle-packaged cytokines rather than free plasma cytokines
4. **Sample:** n=49 ME/CFS, n=49 controls

## Integration Points

- Chapter 7 (Immune Dysfunction - Cytokines): Add IL-2 findings
- Use `\begin{hypothesis}[IL-2 as Biomarker]` (preliminary, EV-specific, needs replication)
- Note: Hunter 2025 also identified IL-2 pathway, providing convergent evidence

## Certainty: Medium
- Novel EV methodology (less established than plasma assays)
- Moderate sample size (n=98 total)
- Single study, needs replication
- But: Convergent evidence from Hunter 2025 IL-2 pathway finding
