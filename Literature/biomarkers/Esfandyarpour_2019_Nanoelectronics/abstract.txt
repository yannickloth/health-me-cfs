ABSTRACT:

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease with a significant societal impact and an estimated prevalence of ~2 million people in the United States. Despite its high prevalence, ME/CFS remains one of the most mysterious diseases in modern medicine. Currently, ME/CFS lacks well-established blood-based biomarkers and is typically diagnosed by clinical history and exclusion of other disorders. Here, we describe an ultrasensitive and accurate assay using a nanoelectronics biosensor that can be used to establish a diagnostic biomarker and a drug-screening platform for ME/CFS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ME/CFS and healthy controls were subjected to hyperosmotic stress and then measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We demonstrated that the assay could accurately identify ME/CFS samples, correctly flagging all 20 ME/CFS patients and none of the 20 healthy controls (P = 4.48E-9). The impedance pattern of ME/CFS samples under hyperosmotic stress showed a unique characteristic that was distinctly different from healthy controls.
