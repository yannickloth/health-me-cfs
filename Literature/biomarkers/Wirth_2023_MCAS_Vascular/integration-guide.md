# Integration Guide: Wirth 2023

## Paper Citation Key
**BibTeX key:** `Wirth2023`

## Recommended Chapters for Integration

### Primary Target: ch13-integrative-models.tex
**File:** `contents/part2-pathophysiology/ch13-integrative-models.tex`
**Section hint:** "Multi-system integration" or "Vascular dysfunction"
**Environment type:** `hypothesis`
**Rationale:** Proposes mechanistic model linking MCAS and ME/CFS; theoretical/integrative rather than primary evidence

**Suggested LaTeX:**
```latex
\begin{hypothesis}[MCAS-ME/CFS Vascular Link]
\label{hyp:wirth2023-mcas-vascular}
Wirth and Löhn~\cite{Wirth2023} propose that ME/CFS and mast cell activation syndrome
(MCAS) share vascular pathomechanisms mediated by beta-2-adrenergic receptor (β2AdR)
dysfunction. Bradykinin (from ischemic muscle) and histamine (from mast cells) both
cause vasodilation and vascular permeability leading to preload failure. Dysfunctional
β2AdR favors mast cell degranulation while ME/CFS stress desensitizes mast cell-
stabilizing receptors, creating bidirectional worsening.
Study: (mechanistic model, certainty: Low-Medium).
This may explain the frequent comorbidity of MCAS in ME/CFS patients.
\end{hypothesis}
```

### Secondary Target: ch07-immune-dysfunction.tex
**File:** `contents/part2-pathophysiology/ch07-immune-dysfunction.tex`
**Section hint:** "Mast cell activation"
**Suggested inline citation:**
```latex
Mast cell activation may interact bidirectionally with ME/CFS pathophysiology through
shared vascular dysfunction, with β2-adrenergic receptor impairment linking the two
conditions~\cite{Wirth2023}.
```

## Key Points to Convey

1. **Two mediator pathways** - bradykinin (ME/CFS) vs. histamine (MCAS), but overlap
2. **β2AdR central** - receptor dysfunction links both conditions
3. **Bidirectional worsening** - ME/CFS worsens MCAS, MCAS worsens ME/CFS
4. **Vascular mechanism** - preload failure from vasodilation and permeability
5. **Treatment implications** - beta-blocker caution, mast cell stabilizers may help both

## Certainty Assessment for Integration

- **Quality:** Medium (mechanistic model, peer-reviewed, theoretical)
- **Sample:** Review/theoretical model (not primary data)
- **Replication:** Model not yet empirically tested
- **Limitations:** Theoretical/speculative; needs clinical validation; unclear how many ME/CFS patients have MCAS
