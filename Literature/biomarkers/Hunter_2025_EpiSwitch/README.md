# Hunter et al., 2025: EpiSwitch Epigenetic Biomarkers

## Paper Summary

Development of blood-based diagnostic test using 200 chromosome conformation markers achieving 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Pathway analysis revealed IL-2, TNFα, toll-like receptor, and JAK/STAT involvement.

## Key Findings

1. **Diagnostic accuracy:** 92% sensitivity, 98% specificity (n=47 patients, n=61 controls)
2. **Epigenetic biomarkers:** 200 chromosome conformation signatures distinguish ME/CFS
3. **IL-2 pathway highlighted:** Overlaps with existing therapies (Rituximab, glatiramer acetate)
4. **Severe patients:** Study focused on severely affected ME/CFS

## Integration Points

- Chapter 7 (Immune Dysfunction): Add IL-2 pathway findings
- Appendix: Potential diagnostic biomarker (high specificity)
- Use `\begin{achievement}[Epigenetic Diagnostic Biomarkers]` for 92/98% accuracy

## Certainty: Medium-High
- High diagnostic accuracy but single study
- Needs independent validation
- Proprietary technology (EpiSwitch) limits replication
- Severe patients only (may not generalize to mild/moderate)
