# Che et al., 2025: Heightened Innate Immunity in ME/CFS

## Paper Summary

Multi-omics study demonstrating exaggerated innate immune responses in ME/CFS, particularly in women >45 with low estradiol. Patients showed hyperinflammatory cytokine responses to microbial stimulation (heat-killed Candida albicans), with IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines elevated before and especially after exercise.

## Key Findings

1. **Exaggerated immune responses:** Higher IL-6 and proinflammatory cytokines after microbial stimulation
2. **Sex-specific effects:** Pronounced in women >45 years with low estradiol levels
3. **Exercise amplification:** Post-exercise samples showed even greater immune activation
4. **Metabolic abnormalities:** Impaired energy production (TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism)

## Integration Points

- Chapter 7 (Immune Dysfunction): Add sex-specific cytokine findings
- Chapter 9 (Endocrine): Link cytokines to estradiol levels
- Chapter 6 (Energy Metabolism): Connect immune activation to metabolic abnormalities
- Use `\begin{observation}[Sex-Specific Immune Dysregulation]` for estradiol finding

## Certainty: High
- Rigorous multi-omics approach
- Published in NPJ journal (Nature portfolio)
- Walitt/Lipkin group (continuity with NIH study)
