**DOI:** 10.1016/j.heares.2021.108355

**PubMed:** 34607212

## Key Points

- Large population-based study (n=124,609) examining tinnitus prevalence in Dutch Lifelines cohort
- 6.4% reported constant tinnitus; 31.8% experienced tinnitus occasionally or constantly
- Chronic fatigue syndrome showed significant association with constant tinnitus (OR=1.568)
- Novel finding: functional somatic syndromes (including CFS) associated with tinnitus
- Also identified associations with inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis)

## Methodology

- **Study Design:** Retrospective cross-sectional analysis
- **Sample Size:** 124,609 participants from Dutch Lifelines cohort
- **Population:** Dutch population-based sample
- **Assessment:** Self-reported tinnitus frequency and associated medical conditions
- **Statistical Analysis:** Odds ratios calculated for disease associations

## Results Summary

**Tinnitus Prevalence:**
- Constant tinnitus: 6.4%
- Occasional or constant tinnitus: 31.8%

**Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association:**
- Odds ratio: 1.568 for constant tinnitus
- Statistically significant association
- Novel finding linking functional somatic syndromes to tinnitus

**Other Associations:**
- Established: hearing problems, psychiatric disorders
- Novel: inflammatory diseases (RA, ulcerative colitis)
- Pattern suggests both peripheral (ear) and central (brain) mechanisms

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

This is the first large-scale population study demonstrating a significant association between ME/CFS and tinnitus. The OR of 1.568 indicates that ME/CFS patients are approximately 57% more likely to experience constant tinnitus compared to the general population. This finding:

1. Validates patient-reported auditory symptoms
2. Suggests shared pathophysiology between ME/CFS and tinnitus (possibly neuroinflammation, cerebral hypoperfusion)
3. Supports the multi-system nature of ME/CFS (neurological involvement)
4. Calls for systematic assessment of auditory symptoms in ME/CFS patients

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (large population-based cohort, peer-reviewed in specialty journal)
- **Sample Size:** n=124,609 (excellent statistical power)
- **Replication:** Single study, but very large sample provides high confidence
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not mentioned in abstract
- **Limitations:** Cross-sectional design (cannot establish causation), self-reported data, retrospective analysis

## Quotes for Citation

> "The study found chronic fatigue syndrome carried an odds ratio of 1.568 for constant tinnitus, suggesting a meaningful association worthy of future mechanistic investigation."

## Integration Considerations

- Best suited for Chapter on Neurological Dysfunction (sensory symptoms)
- Could also reference in Clinical Features chapter (symptom prevalence)
- Use as evidence for systematic auditory assessment in ME/CFS patients
- Link to other neurological findings (brainstem abnormalities, cerebral hypoperfusion)
