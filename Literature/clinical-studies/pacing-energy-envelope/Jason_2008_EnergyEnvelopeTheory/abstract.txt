ABSTRACT:

The Energy Envelope Theory posits that maintaining expended energy levels consistent with available energy levels may reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms. This article reviews the development of the Energy Envelope Theory over a 15-year period as a nonpharmacologic intervention to help patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) self-monitor and self-regulate energy expenditures and learn to pace activities. A metric called a daily energy quotient was established by dividing the expended energy level by the perceived energy level and multiplying by 100, with the prediction that participants who expended energy beyond their level of perceived energy would have more severe fatigue and symptoms and lower levels of physical and mental functioning. Findings indicated that the daily energy quotient was related to several indices of functioning including depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, quality of life, and disability. The Energy Envelope Theory provides a strategy health care professionals can use when working with clients with ME/CFS.
