## Overview

Foundational paper establishing the Energy Envelope Theory and Energy Quotient metric for ME/CFS activity management.

## Key Contribution

Developed and validated the Energy Quotient formula:
```
Energy Quotient = (Expended Energy / Perceived Energy) × 100
```

Demonstrated that patients exceeding their energy envelope (quotient >100%) experienced significantly worse outcomes across multiple health indices.

## Evidence Grade: A

- Large sample (n=114)
- 15-year validation period
- Multiple outcome measures
- Peer-reviewed publication

## Files

- `abstract.txt` - Full abstract from PubMed
- `notes.md` - Detailed summary with methodology and certainty assessment

## Relevance to Document

**Primary integration target:** Chapter 14b (Mild-Moderate Action Plans) - "Crash Dose-Response Relationship"

Provides empirical evidence for dose-response relationship between activity level and symptom severity, supporting pacing guidance.
