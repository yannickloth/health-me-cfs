## Overview

Longitudinal intervention study demonstrating that ME/CFS patients who successfully stay within their energy envelope show significant improvements in functioning over time.

## Key Contribution

**Evidence that pacing is active treatment, not just symptom avoidance:**
- Patients maintaining energy quotient ≤100% showed improvements in physical functioning
- Fatigue severity reduced over time in successful modulators
- Provides stronger evidence for causality than cross-sectional Jason 2008 study

## Evidence Grade: A-

- Longitudinal design (stronger than cross-sectional)
- Clear outcome measures
- NIH-funded research
- Self-reported outcomes (downgrade from A)

## Relevance to Document

**Primary integration target:** Chapter 14b (Mild-Moderate Action Plans) - "Pacing Strategies"

Demonstrates that staying within energy envelope produces functional improvements, not just crash prevention - critical for patient motivation and treatment rationale.
