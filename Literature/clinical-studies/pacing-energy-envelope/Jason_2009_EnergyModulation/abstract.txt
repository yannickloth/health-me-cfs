ABSTRACT:

OBJECTIVE:
To test whether patients with ME/CFS improve when they are able to match their energy expenditure to their energy reserves.

METHODS:
Weekly Energy Quotients were calculated by dividing expended energy by perceived energy and multiplying by 100. Patients were divided into two groups: those who were able to modulate their energy expenditure to be consistent with their perceived energy, and those who were not.

RESULTS:
Those who were able to stay within their energy envelope had significant improvements in physical functioning and fatigue severity over time.

CONCLUSION:
The findings suggest that individuals who learn to modulate their energy expenditure improve over time.

PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS:
Health care providers should incorporate strategies that help patients self-monitor and self-regulate energy expenditures. This may enhance their functioning over time.
