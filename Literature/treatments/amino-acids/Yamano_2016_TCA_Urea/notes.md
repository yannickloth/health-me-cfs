# Index markers of chronic fatigue syndrome with dysfunction of TCA and urea cycles

**Authors:** Yamano E, et al.

**Journal:** Scientific Reports, 2016, Volume 6, Article 34990

**DOI:** 10.1038/srep34990

## Key Points

- **Primary finding:** Significant dysfunction in both TCA (Krebs) cycle and urea cycle in CFS patients
- **Diagnostic potential:** Two metabolite ratios provide clinical screening accuracy
- **Mechanism:** Impaired energy production and ammonia detoxification
- **L-Citrulline:** Significantly decreased (urea cycle dysfunction marker)
- **L-Malate:** Significantly decreased (TCA cycle intermediate)

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Metabolomic case-control study

**Measurements:**
- Plasma metabolites via CE-TOFMS (capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry)
- TCA cycle intermediates: citrate, isocitrate, malate
- Urea cycle metabolites: citrulline, ornithine
- Glucose and branched-chain amino acids

## Clinical Implications

### Energy Production
- Reduced TCA cycle activity → impaired ATP production
- Malate deficiency → disrupted Krebs cycle function
- May explain fatigue and post-exertional malaise

### Ammonia Detoxification
- Citrulline deficiency with ornithine elevation → urea cycle dysfunction
- Impaired ammonia clearance may contribute to cognitive symptoms
- Potential target for therapeutic intervention

### Diagnostic Biomarkers
Two ratio-based indices:
1. **Pyruvate/isocitrate ratio:** Elevated in CFS
2. **Ornithine/citrulline ratio:** Elevated in CFS

Combined model provides discrimination accuracy suitable for clinical use

## Amino Acid Connection

### L-Citrulline
- **Finding:** Significantly decreased in CFS patients
- **Normal function:** Urea cycle intermediate, NO precursor
- **Clinical implication:** Supplementation may restore urea cycle function

### L-Malate
- **Finding:** Significantly decreased in CFS patients
- **Normal function:** TCA cycle intermediate, NADH transport (malate-aspartate shuttle)
- **Clinical implication:** Citrulline-malate supplementation addresses both deficiencies

### Ornithine
- **Finding:** Significantly elevated (metabolic bottleneck)
- **Interpretation:** Conversion to citrulline is impaired
- **Clinical implication:** Focus on downstream supplementation (citrulline)

## Limitations

- Cross-sectional design (cannot establish causality)
- Does not test intervention (supplementation)
- Sample size not specified in abstract
- Unknown whether metabolite changes are primary or secondary

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (rigorous metabolomic analysis, peer-reviewed in Nature journal)
- **Sample Size:** Not specified in available abstract
- **Replication:** Consistent with other metabolomic studies showing TCA dysfunction
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not specified

## Integration Relevance

**High priority for:**
- Chapter 11: Metabolic and Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- Chapter 19: Nutritional and Metabolic Interventions
- Appendix F: Laboratory Testing (diagnostic biomarkers)

**Rationale for L-Citrulline-Malate supplementation:**
- Directly addresses two documented deficiencies
- Targets both energy production (malate) and nitrogen metabolism (citrulline)
- May restore TCA and urea cycle function simultaneously
