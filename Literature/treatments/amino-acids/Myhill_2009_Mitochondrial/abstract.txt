ABSTRACT:
This study demonstrates a strong correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction and CFS severity (P<0.001). Researchers measured five ATP-related factors in neutrophils and found that 70 of 71 patients fell below normal control ranges on the "Mitochondrial Energy Score," with only one patient overlapping normal values.

Key biochemical abnormalities identified:
- Reduced ATP availability
- Impaired oxidative phosphorylation efficiency
- Deficient ADP/ATP translocator function

Sample: 71 CFS patients (54 female, 17 male) and 53 healthy controls (40 female, 13 male).

The 'ATP profile' test is a powerful diagnostic tool differentiating energy deficiency from psychological causes. The authors conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction represents "the immediate cause of CFS symptoms," though they acknowledge uncertainty regarding whether this is primary or secondary damage.
