# Key Findings: Myhill et al. 2009 - Mitochondrial Dysfunction in CFS

## Main Findings

1. **Near-Universal Mitochondrial Dysfunction:** 98.6% (70/71) of CFS patients showed abnormal Mitochondrial Energy Score below normal range, vs 0 healthy controls

2. **Strong Severity Correlation:** Mitochondrial dysfunction correlated significantly with CFS severity (P<0.001)

3. **Multiple Pathway Impairment:**
   - Reduced ATP availability
   - Impaired oxidative phosphorylation efficiency
   - Deficient ADP/ATP translocator function

4. **Diagnostic Utility:** ATP profile test provides objective biomarker distinguishing energy deficiency from psychological causes

## Clinical Implications

- Mitochondrial dysfunction represents the immediate cause of symptoms in ME/CFS
- Nutritional support targeting mitochondrial function is rational treatment approach
- ATP profile testing can guide diagnosis and monitor treatment response
- Essential nutrients (including amino acids) are required for proper mitochondrial function

## Limitations

- Does not establish causality (primary vs secondary dysfunction)
- No specific amino acid supplementation protocols provided
- Observational design limits treatment implications
- Authors have potential conflict of interest (clinical practice)

## Integration Points

### Chapter 11: Metabolic and Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- **Evidence type:** achievement (diagnostic test development)
- **Cites as:** Strong correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction and CFS severity
- **Key data:** 98.6% of patients show abnormal ATP profiles

### Chapter 19: Nutritional and Metabolic Interventions
- **Evidence type:** hypothesis (rationale for amino acid supplementation)
- **Cites as:** Mitochondria require essential amino acids for proper function
- **Note:** Specific protocols not provided in this paper

### Appendix F: Laboratory Testing
- **Evidence type:** achievement (validated diagnostic test)
- **Cites as:** ATP profile test differentiates energy deficiency from psychological causes

## Certainty for Integration

**Quality:** Medium
- Well-designed observational study
- Clear methodology and diagnostic criteria
- Good sample size (n=71)
- Strong statistical significance (P<0.001)

**Limitations for clinical use:**
- No intervention data
- No specific amino acid protocols
- Potential bias (authors run clinical practice)
- Causality unclear

**Recommendation:** Cite for diagnostic correlation and rationale for metabolic support, but seek additional sources for specific amino acid supplementation protocols.
