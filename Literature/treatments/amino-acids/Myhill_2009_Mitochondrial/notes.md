# Chronic fatigue syndrome and mitochondrial dysfunction

**Authors:** Sarah Myhill, Norman E Booth, John McLaren-Howard

**Journal:** International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, 2009, Volume 2(1), Pages 1-16

**PMID:** 19436827

**DOI:** Not explicitly provided in document

## Key Points

- **Primary finding:** Strong correlation (P<0.001) between mitochondrial dysfunction and CFS severity
- **Diagnostic power:** 70 of 71 CFS patients (98.6%) scored below normal on Mitochondrial Energy Score
- **Mechanism:** Impaired ATP production through multiple pathways (availability, oxidative phosphorylation, ADP/ATP translocator)
- **Clinical utility:** ATP profile test can differentiate energy deficiency from psychological causes

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Observational case-control study

**Sample Size:**
- 71 CFS patients (54 female, 17 male)
- 53 healthy controls (40 female, 13 male)

**Measurements:**
- Five ATP-related factors in neutrophils
- Mitochondrial Energy Score (composite measure)
- ATP availability
- Oxidative phosphorylation efficiency
- ADP/ATP translocator function

## Clinical Implications

- Mitochondrial dysfunction is the immediate cause of CFS symptoms
- Nutritional support needed: "mitochondria need all of their essential vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids and amino acids to function properly"
- ATP profile test represents a powerful diagnostic and monitoring tool

## Amino Acid Connection

The document mentions that mitochondria require essential amino acids to function properly but does **not provide specific amino acid supplementation protocols or dosages**. This is a limitation for clinical implementation.

## Limitations

- No specific amino acid supplementation protocols detailed
- Uncertainty whether mitochondrial dysfunction is primary or secondary
- Observational design limits causal inference
- No randomized intervention component

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Medium (observational, good sample size, clear diagnostic criteria)
- **Sample Size:** n=71 (adequate for case-control)
- **Replication:** Replicated in multiple subsequent studies by same and other groups
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Authors run clinical practice treating CFS patients
