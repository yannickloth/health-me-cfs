**Authors:** Shungu DC, et al.

**Journal:** NMR in Biomedicine, 2012, Volume 25(9), Pages 1073-1087

**DOI:** 10.1002/nbm.2772

**PMID:** 22281935

## Key Points

- **First documentation** of reduced cortical glutathione (GSH) in CFS using MR spectroscopy
- **Strong biomarker correlations:** GSH and lactate inversely related to each other and to clinical outcomes
- **Oxidative stress mechanism:** Implicated as central pathophysiological process
- **Treatment strategy:** NAC (not direct GSH) recommended due to blood-brain barrier crossing

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Neuroimaging case-control study using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)

**Measurements:**
- Cortical glutathione (GSH) levels via MRS
- Ventricular lactate levels
- Clinical assessments: physical functioning, energy levels, quality of life, fatigue severity

**Statistical Approach:**
- Correlation analyses between biomarkers and clinical outcomes
- Comparison between CFS patients and healthy controls

## Clinical Implications

### Oxidative Stress Mechanism
- Reduced GSH → impaired antioxidant defense
- Elevated lactate → cellular energetic stress
- Inverse relationship (r = -0.545, p = 0.001) suggests linked mechanisms

### Clinical Correlations

**GSH correlates with:**
- Physical functioning (ρ = 0.506, p = 0.001) - POSITIVE
- Energy levels (ρ = 0.606, p < 0.001) - POSITIVE

**Lactate correlates with:**
- Fatigue severity (ρ = 0.581, p < 0.001) - POSITIVE (worse)
- Quality of life - NEGATIVE
- Physical impairment - POSITIVE (worse)

### Treatment Implications

**Direct Glutathione Supplementation:**
- Unlikely to increase cortical GSH levels
- Blood-brain barrier impermeability is the limiting factor

**N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) Recommended:**
- Crosses blood-brain barrier
- Stimulates in situ GSH synthesis
- Provides neuroprotection

**Supporting evidence cited:**
- NAC supplementation (1800 mg/day for 4 weeks) in pilot studies:
  - Reduced brain free-radical levels
  - Increased GSH levels
  - Improved symptoms

## Amino Acid Connection

### Glutathione (GSH)
- **Composition:** Tripeptide (glutamate, cysteine, glycine)
- **Function:** Primary antioxidant, free radical scavenger
- **Deficiency in CFS:** Significantly reduced in cortical brain regions
- **Clinical impact:** Strongly correlated with disability and symptoms

### N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)
- **Function:** Cysteine precursor for GSH synthesis
- **Advantage:** Crosses blood-brain barrier (unlike GSH)
- **Dosing:** 1800 mg/day demonstrated efficacy in pilot studies
- **Mechanism:** Stimulates endogenous GSH synthesis where needed

### Cysteine
- **Role:** Rate-limiting amino acid for GSH synthesis
- **Delivery:** Via NAC supplementation (more bioavailable than free cysteine)
- **Importance:** GSH synthesis requires adequate cysteine availability

## Limitations

- Cross-sectional design (correlation not causation)
- Sample size not specified in abstract
- Pilot NAC study data referenced but not detailed
- Primary vs secondary oxidative stress unclear

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (rigorous MRS methodology, strong correlations, peer-reviewed)
- **Sample Size:** Not specified in abstract
- **Replication:** Confirmed by subsequent 7T MRI studies (2021)
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not specified

## Related Research

**7 Tesla MRI Study (2021):**
- Confirmed lowered glutathione in anterior cingulate cortex
- Also found reduced total creatine and myo-inositol
- Consistent with oxidative and energetic stress
- Findings "potentially remediable by nutritional intervention"

**NAC Clinical Trials:**
- 2020 NINDS trial: Testing 900mg and 3600mg NAC doses
- Measuring effect on GSH levels and symptoms
- 60 participants, 4-week intervention

## Integration Relevance

**High priority for:**
- Chapter 11: Metabolic and Mitochondrial Dysfunction (oxidative stress mechanism)
- Chapter 12: Neurological Manifestations (brain GSH deficiency)
- Chapter 19: Nutritional and Metabolic Interventions (NAC treatment rationale)
- Appendix F: Laboratory Testing (GSH as biomarker)

**Critical insight:**
- Provides mechanistic basis for NAC supplementation in ME/CFS
- Explains why patient reports "amino acids got me out of bed" (if including NAC or cysteine sources)
- Strong evidence for oxidative stress as treatable pathophysiological mechanism
