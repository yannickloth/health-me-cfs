ABSTRACT:
This case-control study compared 20 CFS patients with 21 healthy controls, examining immune cell function through in vitro laboratory techniques. The research revealed a striking disparity in L-arginine-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation.

Key findings:
- NK activity was significantly increased after treatment with L-arginine (24h) in healthy controls
- The same L-arginine treatment FAILED to enhance NK activity in CFS patients
- Inducible NOS (iNOS) transcript expression appeared normal in both groups
- Direct NO donor compounds produced no effect on NK cells in CFS patients (but stimulated healthy controls)

Mechanism:
- L-arginine normally enhances NK cell function through nitric oxide (NO) production
- This pathway involves the enzyme inducible NO synthase (iNOS)
- Gene expression of iNOS was normal in CFS patients
- However, the functional pathway from L-arginine → NO → NK activation was impaired

Clinical implications:
- Demonstrates specific dysfunction in the NO-mediated immune activation pathway in CFS
- L-arginine supplementation alone may not be effective for immune enhancement in CFS
- Suggests downstream dysfunction beyond substrate availability
- May require combination therapy addressing NO pathway dysfunction
