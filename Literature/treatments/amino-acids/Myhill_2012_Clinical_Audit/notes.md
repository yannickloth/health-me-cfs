**Authors:** Myhill S, Booth NE, McLaren-Howard J

**Journal:** International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, 2012, Volume 6(1), Pages 1-15

**PMCID:** PMC3515971

## Key Points

- **100% response rate:** All 30 compliant patients showed mitochondrial function improvements
- **Average 4x improvement:** Mitochondrial Energy Score increased by factor of 4.14
- **Comprehensive protocol:** Diet + sleep + supplements + pacing
- **Biochemical validation:** Objective ATP profile testing demonstrated improvements
- **Internal control:** 4 non-compliant patients showed minimal/no improvement

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Clinical audit (prospective observational)

**Sample:**
- Initial cohort: 138 ME/CFS patients
- Follow-up testing: 34 patients (25%)
- Good adherence: 30 patients
- Poor adherence: 4 patients (internal control)

**Measurements:**
- ATP profile testing (same as Myhill 2009 paper)
- Mitochondrial Energy Score (MESinh)
- ATPend (ATP availability)
- Oxidative Phosphorylation (Ox Phos)
- Cell-free DNA (tissue damage marker)

**Intervention Duration:** Not specified (clinical practice setting)

## Treatment Protocol

### Four Foundational Components

1. **Evolutionary Correct Diet ("Stone-age diet")**
   - Low carbohydrate
   - High fat, moderate protein
   - Whole foods, avoid processed foods
   - Specific details not provided

2. **Sleep Optimization**
   - Adequate duration
   - Quality sleep hygiene
   - Address sleep disorders

3. **Nutritional Supplementation**
   - At minimum meet Recommended Daily Intakes (RDI)
   - Tailored to individual deficiencies
   - Standard package plus specific mitochondrial support

4. **Activity Management (Pacing)**
   - Appropriate work-rest balance
   - Avoid overexertion
   - Energy envelope management

### Specific Supplements for Mitochondrial Support

**Amino Acids and Derivatives:**
- **L-Carnitine:** Fatty acid transport into mitochondria
- **Glutathione (GSH):** Antioxidant protection

**Vitamins:**
- **Niacinamide (B3/NAD):** Electron carrier in ATP production
- **Vitamin B12:** By injection when indicated (methylation, energy)

**Cofactors:**
- **Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone):** Electron transport chain, antioxidant
- **Magnesium:** Hundreds of enzymatic reactions including ATP synthesis

**Nucleotides:**
- **D-ribose:** Component of adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP)

**Antioxidants:**
- **Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH-PX):** Enzyme that uses GSH
- **Superoxide Dismutase (SOD):** Antioxidant enzyme

**Additional (when indicated):**
- Far-infrared sauna therapy
- Selective chelation therapy for toxin management

### Dosages

**Critical limitation:** Document does NOT provide specific dosages for any supplements. This is a major limitation for clinical implementation.

## Clinical Outcomes

### Compliant Patients (n=30)

**Mitochondrial Energy Score (MESinh):**
- ALL 30 patients improved
- Average improvement: Factor of 4.14
- Range: Individual variation not specified

**ATPend (ATP Availability):**
- 28 of 30 patients improved (93%)
- 2 patients: No data or insufficient improvement

**Oxidative Phosphorylation (Ox Phos):**
- ALL 30 patients improved (100%)
- Indicates enhanced efficiency of ATP production

**Cell-free DNA:**
- Decreased in compliant patients
- Marker of tissue damage/cell death
- Reduction suggests decreased cellular injury

### Non-Compliant Patients (n=4)

- Minimal improvement or deterioration across parameters
- Serves as internal control group
- Demonstrates requirement for sustained adherence

## Clinical Implications

### Efficacy
- Comprehensive mitochondrial support can produce measurable biochemical improvements
- 100% response rate in compliant patients is striking
- Average 4x improvement clinically significant

### Multi-Factorial Necessity
- Single interventions likely insufficient
- Requires:
  - Dietary changes
  - Sleep optimization
  - Comprehensive supplementation
  - Activity management
- All four components appear necessary

### Biochemical Monitoring
- ATP profile testing enables objective monitoring
- Can guide treatment adjustments
- Validates therapeutic approach

### Adherence Critical
- Non-compliant patients did not improve
- Protocol requires sustained commitment
- Complexity may be barrier for some patients

## Amino Acid Relevance

### Direct Amino Acid Support
- **L-Carnitine:** Explicitly included in protocol
- **Glutathione:** Explicitly included (requires cysteine, glutamate, glycine for synthesis)

### Implied Amino Acid Support
- "Standard package of nutritional supplements"
- May include:
  - Essential amino acids
  - Specific amino acids for mitochondrial function
  - NAC (for glutathione synthesis)

**Critical gap:** No specific amino acid dosages or complete supplement list provided

## Limitations

### Study Design
- **Not RCT:** No randomization, no placebo control
- **Clinical audit:** Real-world practice, not controlled study
- **Selection bias:** Compliant patients may be more motivated
- **No blinding:** Patients and practitioners aware of treatment

### Data Completeness
- **75% missing follow-up:** Only 34/138 patients retested
- **Unknown adherence factors:** Why did only 34 get retested?
- **No dosage data:** Cannot replicate protocol precisely
- **No time course:** Duration of treatment not specified

### Generalizability
- Single clinical practice
- Selected patient population
- Resource-intensive protocol
- May not be accessible to all patients

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Medium (prospective audit, objective biomarkers, but not RCT)
- **Sample Size:** Moderate (n=30 compliant, n=4 control)
- **Effect Size:** Large (4x improvement in MESinh)
- **Replication:** Same research group, needs independent replication
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Authors run clinical practice, financial interest

## Related Research

**Builds on Myhill 2009:**
- Diagnostic study → Intervention study
- ATP profile validated as outcome measure
- Same research team, same methodology

**Consistent with:**
- NAC/glutathione research (Shungu 2012)
- TCA cycle dysfunction (Yamano 2016)
- Mitochondrial dysfunction literature broadly

**Gaps:**
- Needs independent replication
- Needs RCT with placebo control
- Needs component analysis (which interventions essential?)
- Needs dosage optimization

## Integration Relevance

**High priority for:**
- Chapter 19: Nutritional and Metabolic Interventions
- Chapter 20: Energy Management and Pacing
- Appendix F: Laboratory Testing (ATP profile monitoring)

**Medium priority for:**
- Chapter 11: Metabolic and Mitochondrial Dysfunction (validates dysfunction is treatable)

**Critical insights:**
1. **Multi-modal approach works:** Diet + sleep + supplements + pacing
2. **Biochemical improvements achievable:** 4x improvement in ATP function
3. **Objective monitoring possible:** ATP profile tracks progress
4. **Adherence essential:** Non-compliant patients don't improve

**Clinical application:**
Patient reports "amino acids got me out of bed" aligns with this comprehensive approach:
- Not just amino acids alone
- Requires full metabolic support package
- Must include pacing and lifestyle factors
- Sustained adherence necessary

**Dosage gap remains:** Need to integrate dosage information from other sources for clinical implementation.
