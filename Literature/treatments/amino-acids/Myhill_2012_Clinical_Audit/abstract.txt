ABSTRACT:
This clinical audit evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive mitochondrial support protocol in 138 ME/CFS patients, with 34 patients (25%) receiving follow-up testing. Of these, 30 patients showed "good regime" adherence while 4 had "poor regime" adherence (serving as internal controls).

Treatment protocol consisted of four foundational components:
1. Stone-age (evolutionary) diet
2. Adequate quality sleep
3. Standard nutritional supplements meeting at least RDI
4. Appropriate work-rest balance (pacing)

Specific supplements for mitochondrial support included:
- Magnesium (Mg)
- Coenzyme Q10/Ubiquinone
- L-Carnitine
- Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/NAD)
- Vitamin B12 (by injection when indicated)
- D-ribose
- Glutathione (GSH) and Glutathione Peroxidase
- Superoxide dismutase (SOD)

Key findings:
- ALL 30 compliant patients showed improvements in major mitochondrial function parameters
- Average improvement factor of 4.14 in Mitochondrial Energy Score (MESinh)
- 28/30 patients improved in ATPend
- All 30 patients improved in Oxidative Phosphorylation (Ox Phos)
- Cell-free DNA (tissue damage marker) decreased in compliant patients
- 4 patients with poor adherence showed minimal improvement or deterioration

Clinical implications:
- Comprehensive mitochondrial support protocol shows measurable biochemical improvements
- Multi-factorial approach addresses multiple aspects of ATP production
- Biochemical improvements correlate with clinical outcomes
- Protocol requires sustained adherence for benefit

Limitations:
- Clinical audit not RCT (no randomization, no placebo control)
- 75% of initial cohort lacked follow-up testing
- Specific supplement dosages not provided
- Potential selection bias (compliant patients more motivated)
