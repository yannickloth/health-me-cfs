# Montoya et al. (2013) - Valganciclovir RCT in ME/CFS

**Landmark Stanford study: First double-blind placebo-controlled trial of valganciclovir in ME/CFS**

## Study Summary

The EVOLVE (Evaluation of Valganciclovir in Longstanding Viral Exposure) study randomized 30 ME/CFS patients with elevated HHV-6/EBV IgG titers to receive valganciclovir 900mg BID (n=20) or placebo (n=10) for 6 months, with 12-month total follow-up.

## Key Results

- **7.4-fold increased response rate** in valganciclovir arm (P=0.029)
- Significant improvements in mental fatigue, overall fatigue, and cognition
- Benefits appeared within 3 months and sustained through 12 months
- Immunological shift toward Th1 cytokine profile
- Well-tolerated with acceptable safety profile

## Evidence Quality

**HIGH** - Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (gold standard)

## Clinical Relevance

This is the strongest evidence for antiviral therapy in ME/CFS to date. While the sample size is modest (n=30), the rigorous methodology and statistically significant results across multiple validated outcome measures provide robust support for valganciclovir use in the HHV-6/EBV-positive subset of ME/CFS patients.

The 50-60% response rate indicates that careful patient selection (herpesvirus serology) is critical, as not all ME/CFS patients will benefit.
