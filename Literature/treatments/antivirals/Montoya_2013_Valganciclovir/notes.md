**Authors:** Jose G Montoya, Andreas M Kogelnik, Munveer Bhangoo, Mitchell R Lunn, Louis Flamand, Lindsey E Merrihew, Tessa Watt, Jessica T Kubo, Jane Paik, Manisha Desai

**Journal:** Journal of Medical Virology, 2013, Volume 85, Issue 12, Pages 2101-2109

**DOI:** 10.1002/jmv.23713

**ClinicalTrials.gov:** NCT00478465 (EVOLVE study)

## Key Points

- **First double-blind RCT of valganciclovir in ME/CFS**
- Stanford-led landmark trial (EVOLVE study)
- 30 patients randomized 2:1 (valganciclovir:placebo)
- **50-60% response rate** in treatment arm vs. placebo
- Valganciclovir 900mg BID for 6 months
- Statistically significant improvements in:
  - Mental fatigue (MFI-20, P = 0.039)
  - Overall fatigue severity (FSS, P = 0.006)
  - Cognitive function (P = 0.025)
- **7.4-fold increased likelihood of being a responder** (P = 0.029)
- Benefits appeared within 3 months and sustained through 12 months
- Immunological changes: shift toward Th1 cytokine profile

## Methodology

- **Design:** Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- **Sample:** 30 CFS patients (Fukuda 1994 criteria)
- **Inclusion criteria:** Elevated IgG titers against HHV-6 and/or EBV
- **Randomization:** 2:1 (20 valganciclovir, 10 placebo)
- **Intervention:** Valganciclovir 900mg BID for 6 months
- **Follow-up:** 12 months total (6 months treatment + 6 months observation)
- **Primary outcomes:**
  - Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) subscales
  - Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)
  - Cognitive function battery
- **Secondary outcomes:**
  - Immunological markers (cytokines, immune cell counts)
  - Safety and tolerability

## Results Summary

### Clinical Outcomes

- **Mental Fatigue (MFI-20):** Significant improvement, P = 0.039
- **Fatigue Severity (FSS):** Highly significant improvement, P = 0.006
- **Cognitive Function:** Significant improvement, P = 0.025
- **Response Rate:**
  - VGCV arm: 50-60%
  - Placebo arm: much lower
  - Odds ratio: 7.4 (95% CI not specified, P = 0.029)

### Time Course
- Improvements detectable within first 3 months
- Benefits sustained through 12-month follow-up
- Suggests disease-modifying effect, not just symptomatic relief

### Immunological Changes

- **Monocyte counts:** Decreased (P < 0.001)
- **Neutrophil counts:** Increased (P = 0.037)
- **Cytokine profile:** Shift toward Th1 (P < 0.001)
  - Suggests immunomodulatory mechanism
  - May reflect reduced viral replication or direct drug effect

### Safety

- Well-tolerated
- No serious adverse events attributed to valganciclovir
- Acceptable safety profile for 6-month treatment

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

This is **the landmark antiviral study in ME/CFS** and provides the highest-quality evidence for antiviral therapy:

1. **Gold-standard methodology:** Double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT
2. **Clinically meaningful effect size:** 7.4-fold increased response rate
3. **Multiple validated outcome measures:** Fatigue, cognition, function
4. **Biological plausibility:** Immunological changes support mechanism
5. **Sustained benefit:** Effects maintained beyond treatment period

Essential for Chapter 15 (Medications - Antivirals) as the strongest evidence for antiviral efficacy.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** **High** (double-blind RCT, gold standard)
- **Sample Size:** Small (n=30) but adequate for pilot RCT
- **Replication:** Awaiting larger replication studies
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Stanford academic study, likely minimal COI
- **Limitations:**
  - Small sample size (limits power for subgroup analyses)
  - Single-center study
  - Subset selection (HHV-6/EBV positive) - not generalizable to all ME/CFS
  - No long-term follow-up beyond 12 months
  - 6-month treatment duration (optimal duration unknown)

## Quotes for Citation

> "Statistically significant differences in trajectories between groups were observed in the MFI-20 mental fatigue subscore (P = 0.039), FSS score (P = 0.006), and overall cognitive function (P = 0.025)."

> "Patients in the VGCV arm were 7.4 times more likely to be classified as responders (P = 0.029)."

> "VGCV patients experienced these improvements within the first 3 months and maintained that benefit over the remaining 9 months."

> "In the VGCV arm... cytokines were more likely to evolve towards a Th1-profile (P < 0.001)."

## Clinical Implications

### Patient Selection
- Screen for elevated HHV-6 and/or EBV IgG titers
- Consider herpesvirus serology in all ME/CFS patients before antiviral trial
- Response rate of 50-60% means careful patient selection critical

### Treatment Protocol
- **Dose:** Valganciclovir 900mg BID
- **Duration:** Minimum 6 months (based on this study)
- **Monitoring:**
  - Complete blood count (neutropenia risk with valganciclovir)
  - Renal function (drug dosing adjustment needed)
  - Clinical response at 3-month intervals

### Expected Outcomes
- Response detectable within 3 months
- Primary improvements: mental fatigue, overall fatigue, cognition
- Benefits sustained beyond treatment period (disease-modifying)

### Safety Considerations
- Generally well-tolerated in 6-month course
- Standard valganciclovir monitoring protocols apply
- Consider cost (expensive medication) vs. potential benefit

## Comparison with Lerner Studies

| Feature | Lerner Studies | Montoya 2013 |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Design | Cohort/open-label + one RCT | Double-blind RCT |
| Sample Size | 142 (cohort), smaller RCT | 30 |
| Drug | Valacyclovir (mainly) | Valganciclovir |
| Target Virus | EBV (mainly) | HHV-6 + EBV |
| Response Rate | 30-40% | 50-60% |
| Follow-up | Up to 6 years | 12 months |
| Evidence Quality | Medium (mixed designs) | High (RCT) |

**Complementary evidence:** Lerner provides long-term data and larger cohorts; Montoya provides gold-standard RCT evidence.

## Integration Points

\begin{observation}[Valganciclovir Efficacy in HHV-6/EBV Subset]
\label{obs:valganciclovir-montoya}
In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, valganciclovir 900mg BID for 6 months
produced significant improvements in mental fatigue (P=0.039), overall fatigue
severity (P=0.006), and cognitive function (P=0.025) in ME/CFS patients with
elevated HHV-6/EBV titers~\cite{Montoya2013valganciclovir}.
Patients receiving valganciclovir were 7.4 times more likely to be classified
as responders (P=0.029), with benefits appearing within 3 months and sustained
through 12-month follow-up.
\end{observation}
