# Key Findings: Montoya 2013 Valganciclovir RCT

## Main Findings

1. **Clinical Efficacy:** Valganciclovir 900mg BID for 6 months significantly improved mental fatigue (P=0.039), overall fatigue severity (P=0.006), and cognitive function (P=0.025) in ME/CFS patients with elevated HHV-6/EBV titers.

2. **Response Rate:** 50-60% of patients in valganciclovir arm responded to treatment, with 7.4-fold increased likelihood of being classified as responder compared to placebo (P=0.029).

3. **Time Course:** Benefits appeared within first 3 months and were sustained through 12-month follow-up, suggesting disease-modifying effect rather than symptomatic relief.

4. **Immunomodulation:** Valganciclovir treatment associated with decreased monocyte counts (P<0.001), increased neutrophil counts (P=0.037), and shift toward Th1 cytokine profile (P<0.001).

5. **Safety:** Well-tolerated with acceptable safety profile over 6-month treatment period.

## Clinical Implications

- Herpesvirus serology screening (HHV-6, EBV IgG titers) should be performed before considering antiviral therapy
- Valganciclovir can be considered in subset of ME/CFS patients with elevated herpesvirus titers
- Response assessment should occur at 3-month intervals
- Treatment duration of at least 6 months recommended based on this study
- Benefits may persist beyond treatment period (sustained at 12 months)

## Limitations

- Small sample size (n=30) limits generalizability
- Single-center study
- Results only applicable to HHV-6/EBV-positive subset
- No long-term follow-up beyond 12 months
- Optimal treatment duration unknown (6 months used, but longer may be beneficial)
- Cost considerations (valganciclovir is expensive)

## Integration Points

### Chapter 15: Medications - Antivirals
- Primary evidence for valganciclovir efficacy in ME/CFS
- Cite as: **observation** (high-quality RCT evidence)
- Include response rate data and statistical outcomes
- Emphasize subset-specific benefit (not all ME/CFS patients)

### Appendix: Treatment Protocols
- Template for herpesvirus screening before antiviral therapy
- Valganciclovir dosing protocol: 900mg BID for minimum 6 months
- Monitoring schedule: CBC and renal function at baseline and regular intervals
- Response assessment criteria at 3, 6, and 12 months

### Comparison with Other Antivirals
- Contrasts with Lerner's valacyclovir studies (different drug, target virus)
- Higher response rate (50-60% vs. 30-40%) but different patient populations
- Gold-standard RCT evidence vs. Lerner's cohort/mixed designs
