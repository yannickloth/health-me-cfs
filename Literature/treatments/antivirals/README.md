# Antiviral Therapy Literature for ME/CFS

This folder contains key studies on antiviral therapy in ME/CFS, focusing on herpesvirus-directed treatment.

## Overview

Antiviral therapy represents one of the more evidence-based treatment approaches for a subset of ME/CFS patients with evidence of active herpesvirus infection (primarily EBV, HHV-6, and CMV). The evidence base consists primarily of the Lerner series of studies (2002-2010) and the landmark Montoya 2013 randomized controlled trial.

## Evidence Summary

### Response Rates
- **Valacyclovir (Lerner studies):** 30-40% response in EBV-subset patients without co-infections
- **Valganciclovir (Montoya 2013):** 50-60% response in HHV-6/EBV-positive patients

### Key Findings
1. **Subset-directed therapy is essential:** Single-virus infections respond better than co-infections
2. **Herpesvirus serology screening required:** Not all ME/CFS patients will benefit
3. **Long-term treatment may be needed:** Studies show benefit sustained over months to years
4. **Objective improvements documented:** Cardiac function, cognitive testing, validated fatigue scales
5. **Acceptable safety profile:** Long-term use (up to 3+ years) shown to be safe

## Studies in This Folder

### Lerner Series (Valacyclovir)

| Study | Year | Design | Sample | Key Finding |
|-------|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Lerner 2002](Lerner_2002_Valacyclovir/) | 2002 | Open-label | n=25 | EBV-only subset responded; co-infections did not |
| [Lerner 2007](Lerner_2007_Valacyclovir_36mo/) | 2007 | Placebo-controlled RCT | n=~20-25 | Sustained benefit over 36 months; validated 2002 findings |
| [Lerner 2010](Lerner_2010_Antivirals_142pt/) | 2010 | Prospective cohort | n=142 | Large-scale real-world evidence; 30-40% response rate |

### Montoya Study (Valganciclovir)

| Study | Year | Design | Sample | Key Finding |
|-------|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Montoya 2013](Montoya_2013_Valganciclovir/) | 2013 | Double-blind RCT (EVOLVE) | n=30 | 7.4× increased response; 50-60% improvement in validated outcomes |

## Evidence Quality Assessment

### High-Quality Evidence (RCTs)
- **Lerner 2007:** Placebo-controlled, 36-month follow-up
- **Montoya 2013:** Double-blind placebo-controlled, gold standard

### Medium-Quality Evidence
- **Lerner 2010:** Large cohort (n=142), prospective, but observational
- **Lerner 2002:** Open-label, small sample, but confirmed by later studies

## Clinical Application

### Patient Selection Criteria
1. **Herpesvirus serology screening:**
   - EBV VCA IgG, EBNA IgG, Early Antigen IgG
   - HHV-6 IgG
   - CMV IgG
2. **Elevated titers** suggest potential for antiviral response
3. **Single infection** vs. **co-infections** affects treatment choice

### Treatment Protocols

**Valacyclovir (for EBV-subset):**
- Dose: Pharmacokinetic dosing (typically 1-2g daily in divided doses)
- Duration: Minimum 6 months, may extend to years
- Best for: Single EBV infection without co-infections
- Evidence: Lerner 2002, 2007, 2010

**Valganciclovir (for HHV-6/EBV/CMV):**
- Dose: 900mg BID
- Duration: Minimum 6 months based on Montoya 2013
- Best for: HHV-6/EBV-positive patients
- Evidence: Montoya 2013 (gold standard)
- Monitoring: CBC (neutropenia risk), renal function

### Expected Outcomes
- Response detectable within **3 months**
- Benefits sustained beyond treatment period
- Improvements in: fatigue, cognitive function, cardiac function (subset)
- **Not a cure:** 30-60% response rate; many patients do not respond

## Certainty Assessment Summary

| Study | Quality | Replication | Sample | Overall Certainty |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Lerner 2002 | Medium | Yes (2007) | Small | Medium |
| Lerner 2007 | High | Yes (2002, 2010) | Small-Medium | High |
| Lerner 2010 | Medium-High | Yes (2002, 2007) | Large | Medium-High |
| Montoya 2013 | High | Awaiting | Small | High |

**Overall Evidence Base:** **Medium-High to High**

The combination of placebo-controlled RCTs (Lerner 2007, Montoya 2013) with large cohort data (Lerner 2010) provides robust support for subset-directed antiviral therapy in ME/CFS.

## Limitations and Caveats

1. **Selection bias:** All studies involve specialty clinics with herpesvirus focus
2. **Subset-specific:** Results only apply to herpesvirus-positive patients
3. **Modest response rates:** 30-60% benefit means many patients won't respond
4. **Cost considerations:** Valganciclovir is expensive; insurance coverage varies
5. **Long-term replication needed:** Montoya 2013 awaits larger confirmatory trials
6. **Optimal duration unknown:** Studies show benefit but don't define ideal treatment length
7. **Co-infection management unclear:** Limited evidence for combination antiviral therapy

## Future Research Needs

- Larger multi-center RCTs
- Optimal treatment duration studies
- Combination therapy trials for co-infections
- Biomarkers to predict antiviral response
- Cost-effectiveness analyses
- Long-term follow-up beyond 3 years
