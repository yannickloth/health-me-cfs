# Lerner et al. (2010) - Subset-Directed Antivirals in 142 CFS Patients

**Largest and most comprehensive Lerner cohort study on antiviral therapy in ME/CFS**

## Study Summary

Prospective cohort study following 142 CFS patients at one clinic from 2001-2007, receiving subset-directed antiviral therapy (valacyclovir and/or valganciclovir) based on herpesvirus serology. Patients stratified into groups: Group A (single infection), Group B (co-infections), Group C (controls).

## Key Results

- **Group A (single infection):** Highly significant improvement (P=0.0001)
- **Energy Index Point Scale:** Significant increase (P<0.0001)
- **Response rate:** 30-40% in appropriately selected patients
- **Herpesvirus prevalence:** EBV involved in 81% of cases
- **Co-infections:** Poorer response to single-agent therapy

## Evidence Quality

**MEDIUM-HIGH** - Large prospective cohort with long-term follow-up (not RCT)

## Clinical Relevance

This study provides the most comprehensive real-world evidence for subset-directed antiviral therapy in ME/CFS. The large sample size (n=142) and long follow-up period (2001-2007) offer valuable insights into long-term treatment outcomes. However, the observational design and selection bias (single specialized clinic) limit causal inference.

The finding that co-infections respond poorly to single-agent therapy has important clinical implications for treatment planning.
