**DOI:** 10.2147/VAAT.S10695

## Key Points

- Largest Lerner cohort study: 142 CFS patients followed 2001-2007
- Group A (single herpesvirus infection): significant improvement with subset-directed antivirals
- Group B (co-infections): poorer response, suggesting need for combination therapy
- 30-40% overall response rate in appropriately selected patients
- EBV involvement documented in 81% of CFS cases (28.3% single infection, 52.8% co-infection)
- Energy Index Point Scale (EIPS) validated as outcome measure

## Methodology

- Prospective cohort study design
- 142 patients followed every 4-6 weeks from 2001-2007
- Serological classification into groups based on herpesvirus status:
  - Group A: Single herpesvirus infection (EBV, CMV, or HHV-6)
  - Group B: Co-infections (multiple herpesviruses)
  - Group C: Control/comparison group
- Subset-directed therapy: valacyclovir for EBV, valganciclovir for CMV/HHV-6
- Primary endpoint: Energy Index Point Scale (EIPS) score
- Secondary endpoint: return to normal/near-normal life

## Results Summary

- **Group A (no co-infections):** Highly significant improvement (P = 0.0001)
  - EIPS increased significantly (P < 0.0001)
  - Many returned to near-normal or normal life
  - Response rate: 30-40%

- **Group B (co-infections):** Limited benefit from single-agent therapy
  - Suggests need for combination antivirals
  - Poorer outcomes than Group A

- **Herpesvirus prevalence in CFS cohort:**
  - EBV single infection: 28.3%
  - EBV + CMV/HHV-6 co-infection: 52.8%
  - Total EBV involvement: 81%

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

This is the most comprehensive Lerner study and provides critical evidence for:
1. Subset-directed antiviral therapy in ME/CFS
2. Importance of screening for co-infections
3. Long-term treatment outcomes (6+ years of data)
4. Herpesvirus prevalence estimates in ME/CFS

Essential for Chapter 15 (Medications) - demonstrates real-world effectiveness over extended treatment periods and validates subset selection strategy.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Medium-High (large cohort, prospective, long-term follow-up)
- **Sample Size:** n=142 (excellent for single-center study)
- **Replication:** Consistent with earlier Lerner studies (2002, 2007)
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not disclosed
- **Limitations:**
  - Not randomized controlled trial (cohort/observational design)
  - Single-center study
  - Selection bias (patients presenting to Lerner's herpesvirus-focused clinic)
  - No placebo control (though 2007 study addressed this)

## Quotes for Citation

> "Group A herpesvirus CFS patients (no coinfections) returned to a near-normal to normal life (P = 0.0001), with the long-term EIPS value increasing (primary endpoint, P < 0.0001) with subset-directed long-term valacyclovir and/or valganciclovir therapy."

> "EBV nonpermissive replication is the cause of 28.3% of 106 consecutive CFS cases, and is etiologic with human cytomegalovirus and/or human herpes virus 6 as a coinfection in an additional 52.8% of CFS cases."

## Clinical Implications

- Herpesvirus serology testing essential before starting antiviral therapy
- Single-agent antivirals effective only in single-infection subset
- Co-infections may require combination antiviral therapy
- Long-term treatment (years) may be necessary for sustained benefit
- 30-40% response rate suggests antivirals benefit significant minority
- 60-70% non-response rate indicates need for careful patient selection
- EIPS can be used to track treatment response objectively
