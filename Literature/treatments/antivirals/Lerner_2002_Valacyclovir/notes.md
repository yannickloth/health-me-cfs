## Key Points

- First controlled study examining valacyclovir efficacy in EBV-subset CFS patients
- 16 patients with single-virus EBV infection showed improvement after 6 months
- 9 patients with EBV/CMV co-infection did not benefit from valacyclovir alone
- Left ventricular function improvement documented objectively via cardiac imaging
- Established subset-directed approach: single infection responds better than co-infections

## Methodology

- Open-label trial design
- 6-month treatment duration
- Pharmacokinetic dosing of valacyclovir
- Patients stratified by herpesvirus serology (EBV-only vs. EBV/CMV co-infection)
- Cardiac function measured as primary endpoint

## Results Summary

- EBV-only subset (n=16): Clinical improvement and improved left ventricular function
- EBV/CMV co-infection subset (n=9): No significant benefit
- Response rate in appropriate subset: ~30-40% achieving meaningful improvement
- Well-tolerated with acceptable safety profile

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

This is one of the foundational studies in antiviral therapy for ME/CFS. It established:
1. The importance of subset identification (single-virus vs. co-infection)
2. Objective cardiac improvements (not just symptom reports)
3. Foundation for Lerner's later larger cohort studies

Critical for Chapter 15 (Medications) - demonstrates that antiviral response depends on correct subset identification.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Medium (open-label, small sample)
- **Sample Size:** n=25 (16 EBV-only, 9 EBV/CMV)
- **Replication:** Replicated in Lerner's later studies (2007, 2010)
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not disclosed in abstract
- **Limitations:** Open-label design, no placebo control in this phase, small sample

## Quotes for Citation

This study established the principle that CFS patients with single-virus EBV infection respond better to valacyclovir than those with co-infections, suggesting subset-directed therapy is essential.

## Clinical Implications

- Screen for herpesvirus co-infections before starting antiviral therapy
- Valacyclovir may be effective in carefully selected EBV-subset patients
- Co-infections (EBV/CMV) may require combination antiviral therapy
- Cardiac function monitoring may serve as objective outcome measure
