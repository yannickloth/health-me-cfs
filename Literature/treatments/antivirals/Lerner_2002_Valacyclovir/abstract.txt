A six-month trial of valacyclovir in the Epstein-Barr virus subset of chronic fatigue syndrome: improvement in left ventricular function

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a 6-month trial of valacyclovir in single-virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persistent infection chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients. Sixteen CFS patients with EBV-persistent infection improved after 6 months of continuous pharmacokinetic dosing with valacyclovir, while nine CFS patients with EBV/human cytomegalovirus co-infection did not benefit from 6 months of similar treatment. Improvements were documented in left ventricular function as measured by cardiac imaging.
