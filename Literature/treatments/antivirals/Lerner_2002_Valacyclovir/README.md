# Lerner et al. (2002) - First Valacyclovir Trial in EBV-Subset CFS

**Foundational study establishing subset-directed antiviral approach**

## Study Summary

Open-label 6-month trial of valacyclovir in CFS patients stratified by herpesvirus serology. Patients with single-virus EBV infection (n=16) showed clinical improvement and improved left ventricular function, while those with EBV/CMV co-infection (n=9) did not benefit from valacyclovir alone.

## Key Results

- **EBV-only subset:** Clinical improvement + improved LV function
- **EBV/CMV co-infection:** No significant benefit
- **Established subset principle:** Single infection responds better
- **Objective outcomes:** Cardiac imaging showed improvement

## Evidence Quality

**MEDIUM** - Open-label trial, small sample (later confirmed by 2007 placebo-controlled study)

## Clinical Relevance

This is the foundational study in Lerner's series of antiviral research. While the open-label design limits strength of conclusions, it established the critical principle of subset-directed therapy and was later validated by the 2007 placebo-controlled trial.

The use of cardiac imaging as an objective outcome measure was innovative and helped address concerns about subjective symptom reporting.
