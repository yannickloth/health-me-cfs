Valacyclovir treatment in Epstein-Barr virus subset chronic fatigue syndrome: thirty-six months follow-up

This study was a blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial of valacyclovir in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) subset of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), with thirty-six month follow-up. The study confirmed sustained benefit of long-term valacyclovir treatment in EBV-subset CFS patients, validating the findings of the earlier 2002 open-label trial with a more rigorous controlled design.
