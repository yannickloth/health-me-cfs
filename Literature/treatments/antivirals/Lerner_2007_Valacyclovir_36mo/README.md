# Lerner et al. (2007) - 36-Month Placebo-Controlled Valacyclovir Trial

**Gold-standard RCT confirming long-term efficacy of valacyclovir in EBV-subset CFS**

## Study Summary

Blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial of valacyclovir in EBV-subset CFS patients with 36-month follow-up. Confirmed sustained clinical improvement in treatment arm compared to placebo, validating earlier open-label findings with rigorous methodology.

## Key Results

- **Sustained benefit over 36 months** in valacyclovir arm
- **Placebo-controlled design** ruled out placebo effect
- **Long-term safety** demonstrated over 3 years
- **EIPS improvement** validated as outcome measure
- **Replicated 2002 findings** with superior methodology

## Evidence Quality

**HIGH** - Randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded trial (gold standard)

## Clinical Relevance

This is the definitive study validating long-term valacyclovir therapy in EBV-subset ME/CFS. The placebo-controlled design addresses the main limitation of the 2002 open-label study, and the 36-month follow-up provides critical safety data supporting extended treatment duration.

Together with the 2002 and 2010 studies, this forms the core evidence base for subset-directed antiviral therapy in ME/CFS.
