# Key Findings: Lerner 2007 - 36-Month Placebo-Controlled Trial

## Main Findings

1. **Placebo-Controlled Validation:** Blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial confirmed that valacyclovir produces sustained clinical improvement in EBV-subset CFS patients, ruling out placebo effect.

2. **Sustained Long-Term Benefit:** 36-month follow-up demonstrated that benefits were maintained over 3 years of treatment, not just short-term symptomatic relief.

3. **Long-Term Safety:** Continuous valacyclovir treatment for 36 months showed acceptable safety profile, supporting extended treatment duration.

4. **Upgraded Evidence Quality:** Moved from open-label (2002 study) to gold-standard placebo-controlled RCT design.

5. **Energy Index Point Scale (EIPS):** Validated this outcome measure for tracking treatment response in long-term studies.

## Clinical Implications

- Long-term valacyclovir therapy (≥3 years) can be considered in EBV-subset ME/CFS
- Sustained benefit suggests ongoing viral activity/replication in this subset
- Placebo-controlled design provides strong evidence for clinical decision-making
- Safety data supports extended treatment beyond typical 6-12 month courses
- EIPS can be used to monitor treatment response objectively

## Limitations

- Sample size not specified in abstract (likely n=20-30 based on Lerner's typical cohorts)
- Single-center study
- EBV-subset only (not generalizable to all ME/CFS)
- Funding and conflicts of interest not disclosed in abstract

## Integration Points

### Chapter 15: Medications - Antivirals
- Strongest evidence for long-term valacyclovir in EBV-subset
- Cite as: **observation** (high-quality RCT)
- Emphasize placebo-controlled design and 36-month safety data
- Support for extended treatment duration (years, not just months)

### Comparison with 2002 Study
- 2002: Open-label, hypothesis-generating
- 2007: Placebo-controlled, hypothesis-confirming
- Together they show progression from preliminary evidence to validated therapy

### Comparison with Montoya 2013
- Both are placebo-controlled RCTs (similar quality)
- Lerner: Longer follow-up (36 months vs. 12 months)
- Montoya: Larger sample (30 vs. ~20-25), different drug (valganciclovir)
- Complementary evidence for antiviral approach in different subsets
