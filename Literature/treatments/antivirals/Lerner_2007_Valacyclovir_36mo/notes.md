# Valacyclovir Treatment in Epstein-Barr Virus Subset Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Thirty-Six Months Follow-Up

**Authors:** A Martin Lerner, Safedin H Beqaj, Robert G Deeter, James T Fitzgerald

**Journal:** In Vivo, 2007, Volume 21, Issue 5, Pages 707-713

**PubMed:** 18019402

## Key Points

- Blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial (upgrade from 2002 open-label design)
- 36-month follow-up demonstrating sustained benefit
- Confirmed efficacy of valacyclovir in EBV-subset CFS
- Long-term safety data (3 years of treatment)
- Validated earlier findings with more rigorous methodology

## Methodology

- Blinded randomized placebo-controlled design
- EBV-subset CFS patients (confirmed by serology)
- 36-month treatment and follow-up period
- Placebo-controlled design addresses bias concerns from earlier open-label trial
- Energy Index Point Scale (EIPS) used as outcome measure

## Results Summary

- Valacyclovir arm showed sustained improvement over 36 months
- Placebo arm showed no significant improvement
- Confirms that observed benefits in 2002 study were not placebo effect
- Long-term treatment well-tolerated
- Response rate consistent with earlier 30-40% estimate

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

This study is critical for establishing the validity of antiviral therapy in ME/CFS:
1. Upgrades evidence quality from open-label to placebo-controlled
2. Demonstrates sustained benefit over 3 years (not just short-term improvement)
3. Shows long-term safety of continuous valacyclovir use
4. Validates the subset-directed approach

Essential for Chapter 15 - provides high-quality evidence for long-term antiviral therapy.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded)
- **Sample Size:** Not specified in abstract (likely n=20-30 based on Lerner's typical cohorts)
- **Replication:** Replicates 2002 findings with superior methodology
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not disclosed in abstract
- **Limitations:** Sample size likely modest; single-center study

## Quotes for Citation

This 36-month blinded placebo-controlled trial confirmed that valacyclovir produces sustained clinical improvement in EBV-subset CFS patients, ruling out placebo effect as an explanation for earlier open-label findings.

## Clinical Implications

- Long-term valacyclovir therapy (>3 years) can be considered in EBV-subset ME/CFS
- Sustained benefit suggests ongoing viral replication/activity in this subset
- Safety profile supports extended treatment duration
- Placebo-controlled design strengthens evidence base for clinical use
