Background: Post-viral fatigue syndromes (PVFS), including ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, and Long COVID, share mitochondrial dysfunction as a common pathophysiological feature. This overview examines evidence for CoQ10 supplementation across these conditions.

Methods: Narrative review synthesizing evidence from randomized controlled trials, open-label studies, and mechanistic research on CoQ10 for PVFS. Covered conditions: ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, Long COVID.

Key Findings:
- ME/CFS: RCT (n=207) with CoQ10 200mg + NADH 20mg showed significant improvements in fatigue, quality of life, and sleep. Open-label studies (n=27-43) confirmed benefits.
- Fibromyalgia: Multiple RCTs demonstrated 20-40% improvements in pain and fatigue; CoQ10 300-400mg daily effective.
- Long COVID: Mixed results; one study showed 53.5% fatigue reduction vs 3.5% placebo, but crossover trial (n=119) found no benefit.
- Bioavailability critical: Crystal-modified ubiquinone showed 75% superior absorption vs standard formulations.

Mechanisms: Electron transport chain restoration, ATP production, antioxidant effects, mitochondrial membrane stabilization.

Conclusions: CoQ10 supplementation shows promise for PVFS, with strongest evidence in ME/CFS and fibromyalgia. Pharmaceutical-grade formulations essential for clinical efficacy.
