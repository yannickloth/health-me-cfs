   - PMID: 17109576
   - DOI: 10.1089/acm.2006.12.857

### Carnitine and Derivatives

4. **Plioplys1995carnitine** - Plioplys & Plioplys (1995)
   - Journal: Neuropsychobiology
   - Study: Observational study (n=35) measuring serum carnitine levels

   - DOI: 10.1159/000119226

5. **Plioplys1997carnitineTreatment** - Plioplys & Plioplys (1997)
   - Journal: Neuropsychobiology
   - Study: Treatment study with L-carnitine 3g/day for 8 weeks
   - Findings: Significant improvement in 12 of 18 clinical parameters
   - Certainty: MEDIUM (no placebo control mentioned, but multiple outcome improvements)
   - PMID: 9018019
   - DOI: 10.1159/000119325

6. **Vermeulen2004carnitine** - Vermeulen & Scholte (2004)
   - Journal: Psychosomatic Medicine
   - Study: Open-label randomized study (n=90, 3 groups) comparing acetyl-L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, and combination over 24 weeks
   - Findings: 59% improvement with acetyl-L-carnitine (mental fatigue p=0.015); 63% with propionyl-L-carnitine (general fatigue p=0.004)
   - Certainty: HIGH (larger sample, randomized, published in peer-reviewed journal, statistically significant results)
   - PMID: 15039515
   - DOI: 10.1097/01.psy.0000116249.60477.e9

7. **Malaguarnera2011ALCAR** - Malaguarnera et al. (2011)
   - Journal: American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
   - Study: Double-blind RCT in hepatic encephalopathy patients
   - Findings: Acetyl-L-carnitine reduced fatigue and improved cognitive function
   - Certainty: HIGH (well-designed RCT), but LOW for ME/CFS specificity (not CFS patients)
   - Note: Included for understanding acetyl-L-carnitine's mechanism on fatigue/cognition
   - PMID: 21310833
   - DOI: 10.3945/ajcn.110.007393

## Summary of Evidence

### Strong Evidence (Multiple Studies, Positive Results)
- **L-Carnitine and derivatives**: Multiple studies showing reduced serum levels in CFS patients and clinical improvement with supplementation
- **Acetyl-L-carnitine**: Strongest evidence for mental fatigue (Vermeulen 2004)
- **Propionyl-L-carnitine**: Strongest evidence for general fatigue (Vermeulen 2004)

### Moderate Evidence (Limited Studies, Positive Results)
- **NADH**: One positive RCT (Forsyth 1999), one mixed result (Santaella 2004)
- **D-Ribose**: One open-label pilot study with positive results (Teitelbaum 2006)

### Mechanistic Rationale
All supplements target mitochondrial energy metabolism:
- NADH: Electron carrier in oxidative phosphorylation
- D-Ribose: Precursor for ATP synthesis
- Carnitine: Facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for beta-oxidation

## Clinical Implications

1. **Carnitine testing**: Consider serum carnitine levels in CFS workup (Plioplys 1995)
2. **Acetyl-L-carnitine**: 2g/day may improve mental fatigue
3. **Propionyl-L-carnitine**: 2g/day may improve general fatigue
4. **NADH**: 10mg daily showed modest benefit in subset of patients
5. **D-Ribose**: 5g three times daily showed promise but needs RCT confirmation

## Integration into Main Document

These citations support:
- Chapter 15 (Medications and Systems Support) - Mitochondrial support section
- Pathophysiology chapters - Energy metabolism dysfunction
- Treatment approaches - Evidence-based supplementation

## Next Steps

1. Create individual paper folders with abstracts/notes if full text becomes available
2. Consider adding to Appendix H (Annotated Bibliography) under "Mitochondrial Support Therapies"
3. Integrate key findings into Chapter 15 with appropriate environments (observation, hypothesis, speculation)
4. Note limitations (open-label studies, small samples for some trials)

## Literature Gaps

- Large-scale RCTs for D-ribose are lacking
- Combination therapy studies (NADH + CoQ10 + carnitine) are limited
- Long-term follow-up data (>2 years) is sparse
- Subgroup analyses (mild vs severe, duration of illness) needed
