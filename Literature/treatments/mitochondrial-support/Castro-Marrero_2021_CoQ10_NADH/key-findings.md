# Key Findings: CoQ10 + NADH Reduces Fatigue and Improves Quality of Life

## Main Findings

1. **Cognitive fatigue dramatically improved**:
   - Most statistically significant outcome (p < 0.001)
   - Suggests preferential benefit for CNS-related fatigue
   - Supports use in CNS-primary subtype

2. **Overall fatigue severity reduced**:
   - FIS-40 total score: p = 0.022
   - Clinically meaningful improvement
   - Effect size sufficient for patient-reported benefit

3. **Quality of life improved**:
   - SF-36 scores: p < 0.05
   - Multiple domains affected
   - Suggests functional improvement, not just symptom reduction

4. **Sleep objectively improved**:
   - Sleep duration at 4 weeks: p = 0.018
   - Sleep efficiency at 8 weeks: p = 0.038
   - Progressive improvement over treatment course

5. **Effects persist post-treatment**:
   - Benefits maintained at 16-week assessment (4 weeks post-treatment)
   - Suggests structural/metabolic improvement, not just symptomatic masking

6. **Excellent safety profile**:
   - No serious adverse events
   - No treatment discontinuations due to side effects
   - Suitable for long-term use

## Dose-Response and Timing

- **Dose:** 200 mg CoQ10 + 20 mg NADH daily
- **Timing of benefit:**
  - Cognitive fatigue: Early improvement
  - Sleep duration: Significant by 4 weeks
  - Sleep efficiency: Maximal by 8 weeks
- **Treatment duration:** 12 weeks minimum recommended; benefits persist after stopping

## Clinical Implications

- **Evidence level: HIGH** - Well-designed RCT with robust statistical findings
- **Applicability:** All ME/CFS patients, particularly those with cognitive symptoms
- **Combination with other therapies:** No contraindications noted
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Relatively inexpensive supplements with demonstrated efficacy

## Limitations

- **Fukuda criteria:** Study used 1994 Fukuda criteria, predating IOM 2015 criteria
- **Mechanism:** Trial didn't measure mitochondrial function directly (correlational evidence from other studies)
- **Optimal duration unclear:** 12 weeks may not be maximal benefit; longer studies needed
- **Formulation matters:** Bioavailability varies by CoQ10 formulation (not specified which form used)
- **No subgroup analysis:** Didn't analyze by severity, subtype, or onset pattern

## Integration Points

### Chapter 14b: Acute Onset Protocol
- **Core component of mitochondrial support strategy**
- Evidence supports early implementation (if effective in chronic ME/CFS, likely more effective acutely)
- Dose: 200 mg CoQ10 + 20 mg NADH daily
- Timeline: Start immediately, continue minimum 12 weeks
- Expected benefits: Cognitive improvement by 4 weeks, sleep by 8 weeks

### Chapter 13: Integrative Models
- Supports mitochondrial dysfunction hypothesis
- Mechanism: Restores electron transport chain function
- Synergy with OI treatment (improves energy for autonomic compensation)

### Appendix I: Medical Management
- Add to evidence-based supplement recommendations
- Certainty level: HIGH (RCT evidence)
- Practical protocol: Available OTC, no prescription needed

### Appendix H: Annotated Bibliography
- Flagship study for mitochondrial support interventions
- Quality rating: HIGH
- Replication status: Confirms smaller studies
