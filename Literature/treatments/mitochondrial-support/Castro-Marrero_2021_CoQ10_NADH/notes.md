**DOI:** 10.3390/nu13082658

**PMID:** 34444817

## Key Points

- **First large RCT of CoQ10 + NADH combination in ME/CFS**: n=207, properly powered trial

- **Significant improvements across multiple domains**:
  - Cognitive fatigue (p < 0.001) - most dramatic improvement
  - Overall fatigue severity (p = 0.022)
  - Quality of life (p < 0.05)
  - Sleep duration and efficiency

- **Benefits persist post-treatment**: Effects maintained 4 weeks after stopping supplementation

- **Well-tolerated**: No serious adverse events reported

## Methodology

- **Study Design:** Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
- **Sample Size:** n=207 (104 active treatment, 103 placebo)
- **Duration:** 12 weeks treatment + 4 weeks follow-up
- **Intervention:** 200 mg CoQ10 + 20 mg NADH daily
- **Diagnostic Criteria:** Fukuda 1994 criteria
- **Primary Outcomes:**
  - Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS-40)
  - SF-36 Health Survey (quality of life)
  - Cognitive fatigue perception
  - Sleep duration (measured objectively)
  - Sleep efficiency
- **Statistical Analysis:** Intention-to-treat analysis

## Acronym Definitions

- CoQ10: Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone)
- NADH: Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (reduced form)
- NAD+: Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (oxidized form)
- FIS-40: Fatigue Impact Scale (40 items)
- SF-36: Short Form Health Survey (36 items)
- RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial
- ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate
- ROS: Reactive Oxygen Species

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** HIGH
  - Properly randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
  - Adequate sample size (n=207)
  - Intention-to-treat analysis
  - Multiple validated outcome measures
  - Follow-up assessment (durability of effect)

- **Sample Size:** n=207 (large for ME/CFS trials)

- **Replication:** Confirms smaller open-label studies; builds on earlier CoQ10 literature

- **Conflicts of Interest:** No conflicts declared; independent funding

## Mechanistic Rationale

1. **CoQ10 functions:**
   - Electron transport chain component
   - Mitochondrial ATP production
   - Lipid-soluble antioxidant
   - Reduces oxidative stress

2. **NADH functions:**
   - Primary electron donor for Complex I
   - Synergistic with CoQ10 for electron transport
   - Supports NAD+ regeneration for cellular metabolism
   - Precursor for ATP synthesis

3. **Combination rationale:**
   - NADH feeds electrons into Complex I
   - CoQ10 accepts electrons from Complex I and II
   - Together optimize mitochondrial respiratory chain
   - Address documented mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS

## Clinical Implications for Acute Onset Protocol

1. **Evidence-based mitochondrial support**: This is not speculative; it's RCT-proven
2. **Early intervention potential**: If effective in chronic ME/CFS, may be more effective in acute phase when mitochondrial damage is less established
3. **Safe adjunctive therapy**: Well-tolerated, can combine with other interventions
4. **Cognitive benefits particularly strong**: Relevant for CNS-primary subtype
5. **Sleep improvement**: Synergizes with sleep hygiene and circadian interventions
