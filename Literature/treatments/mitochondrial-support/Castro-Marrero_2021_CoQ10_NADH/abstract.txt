Background: ME/CFS is characterized by severe fatigue and reduced quality of life. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are implicated in pathophysiology. This trial evaluated CoQ10 plus NADH supplementation for symptom improvement.

Methods: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. N=207 ME/CFS patients (104 active, 103 placebo). Intervention: 200 mg CoQ10 + 20 mg NADH daily for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes: Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS-40), SF-36 quality of life, cognitive fatigue perception, sleep duration and efficiency.

Results: Significant improvements in treatment group:
- Cognitive fatigue perception: p < 0.001
- Overall FIS-40 scores: p = 0.022
- Quality of life (SF-36): p < 0.05
- Sleep duration at 4 weeks: p = 0.018
- Sleep efficiency at 8 weeks: p = 0.038
Benefits persisted 4 weeks post-treatment.

Conclusions: CoQ10 + NADH supplementation significantly improved fatigue perception, quality of life, and sleep in ME/CFS patients. Combination addresses mitochondrial dysfunction and represents evidence-based adjunctive therapy.
