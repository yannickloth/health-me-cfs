**DOI:** 10.1186/s12967-022-03735-7

**PMID:** 36386945

## Key Points

- Multi-ingredient supplement containing β-caryophyllene and pregnenolone showed significant improvement in Long COVID symptoms
- Preclinical work showed synergistic anti-inflammatory effects of β-caryophyllene and pregnenolone in mouse sepsis model
- 51 patients tracked 12 symptoms over 4 weeks with significant improvements across all measures
- 72-84% of participants showed improvement in each symptom category
- No significant adverse effects reported

## Methodology

**Study Design:** One-arm open-label trial, single site, 51 patients from 18 states

**Duration:** 4 weeks with assessments at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks

**Formulation:** Nine-ingredient supplement including β-caryophyllene and pregnenolone (specific doses not disclosed in abstract)

**Preclinical data:** Mouse model doses were pregnenolone 10 mg/kg and β-caryophyllene 25 mg/kg

**Symptoms tracked (n=12):**
- Fatigue
- Weakness
- Cardiac symptoms
- Neurological symptoms
- Shortness of breath
- Gastrointestinal disorders
- Other symptoms (6 additional categories)

**Statistical significance:** All symptoms p < 0.0001 at both 2 and 4 weeks vs. baseline

## Mechanism

**Proposed mechanisms:**
1. **Anti-inflammatory:** β-caryophyllene and pregnenolone showed synergistic effects in resolving LPS-induced sepsis and inflammation in preclinical models
2. **Neurological:** Targeting neurological disorders associated with Long COVID
3. **Systemic:** Multi-system approach addressing inflammation, neurological, cardiac, and GI symptoms

**Pregnenolone role:**
- Neurosteroid precursor
- Potential HPA axis modulation
- Neuroprotective properties

## Clinical Implications

**Strengths:**
- Significant improvements across all measured symptoms
- Well-tolerated with no adverse effects
- Applicable to outpatient Long COVID population (75% of COVID survivors)
- Potential broader application to chronic inflammatory conditions

**Limitations:**
- No placebo control group (open-label, single-arm design)
- Exact supplement doses not disclosed
- Multi-ingredient formula makes it impossible to isolate pregnenolone's individual contribution
- Small sample size (n=51)
- No long-term follow-up beyond 4 weeks
- Conflict of interest: authors own stock in company holding patent rights

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Low-Medium (open-label, no placebo control, commercial conflict of interest)
- **Sample Size:** n=51 (small)
- **Replication:** None - single study with no independent replication
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Yes - two authors own stock in NTN Enterprises LLC (patent holder)
- **Applicability to ME/CFS:** Moderate (Long COVID shares overlapping symptomatology with ME/CFS)

## Relevance to ME/CFS

**High overlap in symptomatology:**
- Post-exertional malaise (not specifically tracked but "weakness" and "fatigue" measured)
- Cognitive dysfunction (neurological symptoms)
- Autonomic issues (cardiac symptoms, shortness of breath)
- GI disturbances

**Caveats:**
- Cannot isolate pregnenolone effect due to multi-ingredient formula
- Lack of blinding increases placebo effect risk
- No control group limits causal inference
- Commercial conflict of interest raises concerns about objectivity

**Key question:** Would pregnenolone alone (or pregnenolone + single ingredient like β-caryophyllene) show similar effects?
