# Sports Medicine-Adapted Pacing Protocols for ME/CFS

## Overview

This literature collection explores adapting athletic overtraining syndrome (OTS) recovery protocols and periodization principles to ME/CFS pacing strategies. The adaptation is designed for mild-moderate ME/CFS patients with stable baselines who may benefit from structured, quantified recovery approaches.

## Key Concept

**Core Idea:** Apply structured rest-activity cycles (periodization) with objective recovery monitoring (HRV, resting heart rate) and planned deload phases, adapted from sports medicine management of overtraining syndrome.

**Critical Distinction:** This is NOT graded exercise therapy (GET). The approach respects energy envelope theory, includes mandatory regular deloads, treats PEM as a hard stop signal, and prioritizes stability over progression.

**BibTeX Key:** `Bell2023deload`

**Key Findings:**
- Deload frequency: Every 4-6 weeks

**BibTeX Key:** `Meeusen2013overtraining` (already in references.bib)

**Key Findings:**
- OTS parallels ME/CFS: persistent fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disturbance
- Recovery requires structured rest (weeks to months in athletes)
- Shares symptom profile but different timelines

**BibTeX Key:** `Javaloyes2024hrv`

**Key Findings:**
- HRV within SWC (smallest worthwhile change) = training readiness
- HRV below baseline = need for recovery/reduced activity
- Use rolling 7-day averages, individualized thresholds (±0.5-1 SD)

### 4. Subjective Recovery Monitoring
**Citation:** Hooper SL, Mackinnon LT. Monitoring Overtraining in Athletes: Recommendations. *Sports Med.* 1995;20(5):321-327.

**BibTeX Key:** `Hooper2024subjective`

**Key Findings:**
- Subjective measures (POMS, DALDA, RESTQ-Sport) often outperform objective markers
- Daily self-rating scales effective for overtraining detection
- 0-10 scales for recovery, sleep, fatigue, mood

## Adaptation Principles

### Critical Differences from Athletic Protocols

| Aspect | Athletic OTS | ME/CFS Adaptation |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Baseline capacity | Near-normal or above | 10-20% of healthy |
| Recovery timeline | Weeks to months | Months to years |
| Activity definition | Structured training | Activities of daily living |
| Progression rate | Weekly increases | Monthly or none |
| Consequence of error | Temporary setback | Prolonged relapse risk |

### Applicability

**Suitable for:**
- Mild to moderate ME/CFS (ambulatory)
- Stable baseline (4+ weeks without crash)
- Athletic background or comfort with structured approaches
- Access to monitoring tools
- Understanding of conservative implementation

**NOT suitable for:**
- Severe or very severe ME/CFS
- Unstable or deteriorating condition
- Recent major crash (<3 months)
- Tendency toward overachievement
- Psychological distress from metrics

## Evidence Quality

| Component | Quality | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Athletic deload protocols | High | Well-established in sports science |
| OTS-ME/CFS parallels | Medium | Observational; significant differences |
| HRV/RHR monitoring | Medium | Athletic validation; limited ME/CFS data |
| Subjective scales | High | Athletic populations; simple to implement |
| ME/CFS adaptation | Low | Theoretical extrapolation only; no RCTs |
| Safety in ME/CFS | Very Low | No systematic evaluation |

**Overall: Medium to Low certainty for ME/CFS application**

## Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Baseline (Weeks 1-4)
- Establish stable activity baseline
- Implement daily monitoring (RHR, subjective recovery, sleep)
- Optional: Add HRV if device available
- Track PEM frequency and severity
- Calculate personal baseline metrics

### Phase 2: First Deload (Week 5)
- Reduce activity to 50% of baseline
- Focus on rest, sleep extension, gentle movement
- Continue monitoring
- Assess: Do recovery metrics improve?

### Phase 3: Return to Baseline (Weeks 6-7)
- Gradually return to pre-deload activity level
- Monitor for PEM or metric deterioration
- Establish new stability

### Phase 4: Assessment (Week 8)
- Review 8-week data trends
- Decision: Continue cycles / Adjust / Abandon approach

### Long-Term
- Deload every 4-6 weeks (pre-planned OR when metrics indicate)
- Never progress if unstable
- Ultra-conservative increases (5%) only after 3+ months stability
- Immediate rollback if any PEM

## Monitoring Metrics

### Daily
1. **Resting heart rate** (before rising)
   - ≥5 bpm above baseline = red flag
2. **Subjective recovery rating** (0-10 scale)
3. **Sleep quality** (0-10 or qualitative)
4. **PEM occurrence** (yes/no, severity)

### Weekly
1. **HRV trends** (if monitoring)
   - Rolling 7-day average vs. baseline
2. **Activity capacity** (total minutes, quality)
3. **Symptom burden** (overall score)

### Monthly
- Trajectory (improving/stable/declining)
- Deload effectiveness
- Protocol adjustments needed

## Research Gaps

1. No RCTs comparing sports-adapted vs. standard pacing in ME/CFS
2. No validation of HRV or RHR thresholds in ME/CFS
3. Unknown optimal deload parameters (frequency, duration, depth)
4. No long-term outcome data (>6 months)
5. No systematic safety evaluation
6. No validated patient selection criteria

## Distinction from GET

This approach is fundamentally different from graded exercise therapy:

| GET | Sports-Adapted Pacing |
|-----|----------------------|
| Progressive increase indefinitely | Mandatory regular deloads |
| Treats PEM as psychological | Treats PEM as biological stop signal |
| Fixed schedule | Autoregulatory based on metrics |
| Aims to "decondition" avoidance | Respects energy envelope reality |
| One-size-fits-all | Highly individualized |
| Progression is primary goal | Stability is primary goal |

## Clinical Bottom Line

Sports medicine-adapted pacing is a **reasonable experimental approach** for carefully selected mild-moderate ME/CFS patients with stable baselines who are comfortable with structured monitoring. It requires:

- Conservative implementation
- Close monitoring
- Physician guidance
- Willingness to abandon if unhelpful or harmful

Standard flexible pacing remains the evidence-based default for all patients, especially those with severe disease or unstable courses.
