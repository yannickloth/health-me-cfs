BACKGROUND: Deloading is a ubiquitous yet under-researched strategy within 
strength and physique training. How deloading should be integrated into the 
training programme to elicit optimal training outcomes is unknown. To aid its 
potential integration, this study established consensus around design principles 
for integrating deloading in strength and physique training programmes using 
expert opinion and practical experience.
METHODS: Expert strength and physique coaches were invited to an online Delphi 
consisting of 3 rounds. Thirty-four coaches completed the first round, 29 
completed the second round, and 21 completed the third round of a Delphi 
questionnaire. In the first round, coaches answered 15 open-ended questions from 
four categories: 1: General Perceptions of Deloading; 2: Potential Applications 
of Deloading; 3: Designing and Implementing Deloading; and 4: Creating an 
Inclusive Deloading Training Environment. First-round responses were analyzed 
using reflexive thematic analysis, resulting in 138 statements organized into 
four domains. In the second and third rounds, coaches rated each statement using 
a four-point Likert scale, and collective agreement or disagreement was 
calculated.
RESULTS: Stability of consensus was achieved across specific aspects of the four 
categories. Findings from the final round were used to develop the design 
principles, which reflect the consensus achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: This study develops consensus on design principles for integrating 
deloading into strength and physique sports training programmes. A consensus 
definition is proposed: "Deloading is a period of reduced training stress 
designed to mitigate physiological and psychological fatigue, promote recovery, 
and enhance preparedness for subsequent training." These findings contribute 
novel knowledge that might advance the current understanding of deloading in 
strength and physique sports.
