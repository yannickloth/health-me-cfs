## Key Points

- Daridorexant is a selective dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) blocking both OX1R and OX2R
- FDA approved for adult insomnia with sleep onset and/or maintenance difficulties
- Mechanistically distinct from benzodiazepines and z-drugs (no GABA-A interaction)
- Suppresses wake-promoting pathways by blocking orexin signaling
- Phase 3 trials: significant improvements in WASO and LPS at both 25mg and 50mg doses
- 50mg dose superior for both sleep parameters and daytime functioning
- Low adverse event rates (<2% serious AEs)
- No respiratory depression, rebound insomnia, or withdrawal symptoms
- Minimal next-day impairment compared to traditional sedatives

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Review of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials
**Phase 3 Trials:** Two pivotal studies (Study 301 and Study 302)
**Sample Size:** 1,854 adults with chronic insomnia disorder
**Duration:** 3 months of treatment
**Primary Endpoints:** Wake after sleep onset (WASO), latency to persistent sleep (LPS)
**Doses Evaluated:** 25 mg and 50 mg

## Mechanism of Action

**Target:** Dual orexin receptor antagonist (blocks OX1R and OX2R)
**Orexin System:** Hypothalamic neuropeptides that stabilize wakefulness
**Effect:** Inhibits wake-promoting neuronal pathways:
- Histaminergic neurons (tuberomammillary nucleus)
- Serotonergic neurons (dorsal raphe)
- Dopaminergic neurons (ventral tegmental area)
- Cholinergic neurons (basal forebrain, pedunculopontine, laterodorsal tegmental nuclei)

**Key Advantage:** Targeted mechanism avoids widespread neuronal inhibition and associated side effects of GABA-A modulators

## Efficacy Findings

**50mg Dose (Month 3 vs Placebo):**
- WASO: -18.3 minutes (p<0.0001)
- LPS: -11.7 minutes (p<0.0001)
- Subjective total sleep time: +19.8 minutes (p<0.0001)
- Daytime functioning: significantly improved (IDSIQ scores)

**25mg Dose:**
- Significant improvements in sleep parameters
- Less pronounced effects on daytime functioning compared to 50mg

## Safety Profile

**Common Adverse Events:**
- Fatigue
- Nasopharyngitis
- Gait disturbance
- Somnolence
- Diarrhea
- Headache

**Serious Adverse Events:** <2% of participants
**Discontinuation Rates:** 1-3% (low)
**Next-Day Effects:** No significant residual sedation at efficacious doses
**Withdrawal:** No withdrawal symptoms or rebound insomnia
**Tolerance:** No evidence of tolerance development
**Sleep Architecture:** Does not alter sleep stage proportions

## Comparison to Traditional Sleep Aids

**Benzodiazepines/Z-drugs:**
- Work via GABA-A receptor enhancement (non-selective CNS depression)
- Risk of respiratory depression
- Tolerance and dependence potential
- Cognitive impairment and "hangover" effects
- Alter sleep architecture (suppress slow-wave and REM sleep)

**Daridorexant:**
- Targeted orexin pathway inhibition
- No respiratory depression
- Minimal cognitive impairment
- Lower addiction risk
- Preserves natural sleep architecture
- No rebound insomnia

## Certainty Assessment

**Study Quality:** High
- FDA-approved based on Phase 3 RCTs
- Peer-reviewed publication in pharmacy journal
- Multiple large-scale trials

**Sample Size:** n=1,854 (Phase 3 combined)
**Replication:** Multiple studies, consistent findings
**Conflicts of Interest:** Not disclosed in this review article
**Regulatory Approval:** FDA approved (January 2022)

**Overall Certainty:** HIGH for efficacy in general insomnia population

## Limitations

- No head-to-head comparison with other DORAs (lemborexant, suvorexant)
- Not evaluated in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea or COPD
- No specific trials in ME/CFS population
- Limited data on very long-term use (>12 months at time of publication)
- Need for further real-world effectiveness studies

## Clinical Implications

**For ME/CFS Patients:**
- Promising alternative to benzodiazepines/z-drugs for insomnia
- No "hangover" effect - critical for patients with existing severe fatigue
- Preserves sleep architecture - may support restorative sleep
- Low cognitive impairment - important for patients with existing cognitive dysfunction
- Safe for long-term use - ME/CFS sleep disturbances are often chronic

**Patient Requirement Match:**
- 25mg dose appropriate for patients using intermittently
- No withdrawal or rebound insomnia supports intermittent use pattern
- Minimal next-day effects align with need to avoid worsening baseline fatigue

## Integration Points

### Chapter 14 (Symptom Management), Section: Sleep Management
- Add to "Medications for Sleep" subsection
- Cite as: observation or achievement (FDA-approved, Phase 3 data)
- Position: Alternative to traditional sedatives with superior safety profile

### Chapter 15 (Medications Targeting Mechanisms)
- Potentially relevant for neurological/autonomic sections
- Novel mechanism class (DORAs) vs traditional GABAergic agents

### Appendix J (Recommendations)
- Consider for sleep management recommendations
- Particularly relevant given patient's actual use of 25mg daridorexant
