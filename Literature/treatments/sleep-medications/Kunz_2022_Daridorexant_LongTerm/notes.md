## Key Points

- 52-week (12 months) safety study of daridorexant
- 801 patients from Phase 3 trial extensions
- Treatment-emergent AEs: 35-40% (most mild-moderate, 91.2%)
- Falls: 1.1% (<65 years), 2.7% (≥65 years) - no somnolence during falls
- NO withdrawal symptoms (Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Questionnaire scores low)
- NO rebound insomnia - sleep improved during placebo run-out
- NO tolerance - maintained efficacy over 52 weeks
- Safe in medically complex patients: 72.1% with comorbidities, 64.8% on concomitant meds
- Improved morning alertness (not residual sedation)

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Open-label extension of two Phase 3 RCTs
**Sample Size:** 801 patients
**Duration:** Up to 40 weeks extension (following initial 12 weeks = 52 weeks total)
**Doses:** 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or placebo groups
**Population:** Patients with chronic insomnia disorder from pivotal trials
**Primary Outcome:** Safety and tolerability over long-term use
**Key Assessments:**
- Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
- Serious adverse events
- Falls and motor events
- Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire
- Morning sleepiness/alertness
- Rebound insomnia (placebo run-out phase)

## Safety Findings

**Overall Adverse Event Rate:**
- 35-40% across all treatment groups (including placebo)
- 91.2% were mild to moderate in severity
- <10% severe
- Low discontinuation rates due to AEs

**Common Adverse Events:**
- Nasopharyngitis (upper respiratory infections)
- Headache
- Fatigue (slightly more than placebo)
- No dose-dependent increase in severity

**Serious Adverse Events:**
- Rare
- No pattern suggesting drug causality
- Consistent with general population with insomnia

**Falls:**
- <65 years: 1.1%
- ≥65 years: 2.7%
- Importantly: NO evidence of somnolence or impaired attention during fall events
- Lower than typical rates with benzodiazepines/z-drugs

## Withdrawal, Rebound, and Dependence

**Withdrawal Assessment:**
- Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire administered
- Scores remained LOW across all groups
- NO significant differences between active treatment and placebo
- NO withdrawal syndrome upon discontinuation

**Rebound Insomnia:**
- Assessed during placebo run-out phase after treatment cessation
- NO rebound insomnia observed
- Sleep time actually IMPROVED during run-out
- Contrasts sharply with benzodiazepines/z-drugs (often show severe rebound)

**Tolerance:**
- NO evidence of tolerance development over 52 weeks
- Efficacy maintained without dose escalation
- Consistent with mechanism (orexin antagonism vs GABA agonism)

## Morning Alertness and Next-Day Effects

**Key Finding: Improved Morning Alertness**
- Morning sleepiness scores HIGHER than baseline
- Higher scores indicate MORE alertness, NOT more sedation
- No residual sedation or "hangover" effects
- Maintained daytime functioning

**Clinical Significance:**
- Patients wake refreshed, not groggy
- Critical for ME/CFS patients who cannot afford additional daytime impairment
- Supports once-daily nighttime dosing without daytime consequences

## Medically Complex Population

**Comorbidity Profile:**
- 72.1% had at least one comorbidity
- 64.8% taking concomitant medications
- Represents real-world chronic insomnia population

**Common Comorbidities:**
- Chronic pain conditions
- Respiratory conditions
- Cardiovascular conditions
- Psychiatric conditions (depression, anxiety)
- Metabolic conditions

**Safety in Complex Patients:**
- NO new safety signals in comorbid population
- NO significant drug-drug interactions identified
- Maintained favorable safety profile despite medical complexity

**ME/CFS Relevance:**
- ME/CFS patients typically have multiple comorbidities
- Often on complex medication regimens
- This data supports daridorexant safety in polypharmacy context

## Dose-Specific Findings

**10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg:**
- All doses well-tolerated over 52 weeks
- NO dose-dependent increase in adverse events
- Safety profile consistent across dose range
- Allows flexible dosing based on individual needs

**Clinical Implication:**
- 25 mg appropriate starting dose (patient's choice)
- Can escalate to 50 mg if needed without safety concerns
- Can use intermittently without withdrawal risk

## Certainty Assessment

**Study Quality:** High
- Extension of Phase 3 RCTs
- 52-week duration (rare for sleep medications)
- Large sample (n=801)
- Systematic assessment of withdrawal, rebound, tolerance
- Peer-reviewed in major CNS drug journal

**Sample Size:** n=801 (sufficient for safety signals)
**Duration:** 52 weeks (excellent for long-term safety)
**Population:** Real-world chronic insomnia with comorbidities
**Conflicts of Interest:** Multiple authors have pharmaceutical industry relationships; however, standard Phase 3 extension study design

**Overall Certainty:** HIGH for long-term safety and tolerability

## Limitations

- Open-label extension (not blinded)
- Patients who completed initial 12 weeks (selection bias - tolerators)
- Limited to 52 weeks (>1 year data still needed)
- No ME/CFS-specific subgroup analysis
- Predominantly white population (generalizability question)

## Clinical Implications

**For Chronic Insomnia:**
- Safe for long-term use (at least 1 year)
- No need for "drug holidays" or periodic discontinuation
- Suitable for patients requiring ongoing sleep support
- Superior long-term profile vs benzodiazepines/z-drugs

**For ME/CFS Patients:**
1. **Chronic use safety:** ME/CFS sleep disturbances often chronic; 52-week data supports long-term use
2. **Comorbidity safety:** Most ME/CFS patients have multiple comorbidities; study population reflects this complexity
3. **No tolerance:** Sustained efficacy without dose escalation critical for chronic condition
4. **Flexible dosing:** No withdrawal/rebound supports intermittent use (patient's pattern)
5. **Morning function:** Improved alertness critical for patients with existing severe fatigue
6. **Polypharmacy:** Safe with concomitant medications (ME/CFS patients often on complex regimens)

**For Patient's Use Case:**
- Validates intermittent 25 mg use (no withdrawal/rebound)
- Supports escalation to 50 mg if 25 mg becomes insufficient
- Confirms safety for chronic use if continuous therapy becomes necessary
- Reassures about polypharmacy concerns (patient on multiple medications)

## Integration Points

### Chapter 14 (Symptom Management)
- Primary citation for long-term safety of daridorexant
- Data on withdrawal, rebound, tolerance
- Safety in medically complex patients

### Chapter 15 (Medications Targeting Mechanisms)
- Contrast with benzodiazepine/z-drug long-term risks
- Mechanism explains lack of tolerance

### Appendix J (Recommendations)
- Supports long-term daridorexant recommendation
- Safety data for monitoring plan
- Reassurance about chronic use if needed

## Key Quotes for Integration

1. **Long-term safety:** "Over 52 weeks of nightly treatment, daridorexant demonstrated a favorable long-term safety and tolerability profile consistent with 12-week study findings."

2. **No dependence:** "No evidence of physical dependence, tolerance or rebound" observed.

3. **Withdrawal:** "Mean Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire scores remained low and similar across treatment groups."

4. **Rebound insomnia:** "No rebound insomnia observed; sleep time actually improved during placebo run-out phase."

5. **Comorbid patients:** "The study population included 72.1% with comorbidities and 64.8% on concomitant medications. No new safety signals emerged in this medically complex cohort."

6. **Morning function:** "Morning sleepiness scores showed numerically higher values - indicating improved alertness rather than residual sedation."

## Patient Relevance

**Critical Safety Data for Patient's Treatment:**

Patient uses daridorexant 25mg intermittently. This study provides:

1. **Long-term safety confirmation:** If patient needs continuous use, 52-week data supports safety

2. **Intermittent use validation:** No withdrawal/rebound means flexible dosing pattern is safe

3. **Comorbidity reassurance:** Patient has MCAS, POTS, other conditions; study shows safety in complex patients

4. **Polypharmacy safety:** Patient on multiple medications (ketotifen, supplements, etc.); no concerning drug interactions

5. **Dose escalation option:** If 25mg insufficient, 50mg shown safe for 52 weeks

6. **No tolerance concerns:** If effectiveness wanes, not due to tolerance (look for other causes)

**Clinical Context:** This study provides strongest evidence that patient's daridorexant use - whether intermittent or if made continuous - is safe for chronic use in medically complex ME/CFS patient on polypharmacy regimen.
