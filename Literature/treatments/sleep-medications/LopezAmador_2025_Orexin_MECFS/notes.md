## Key Points

- Integrative review of 27 studies on orexin dysfunction in ME/CFS
- Consistent finding: reduced orexin-A levels in ME/CFS patients
- Variable orexin-B responses suggest biomarker potential
- Hypothalamic orexinergic impairment is central feature of ME/CFS
- No clinical trials yet in ME/CFS, but DORA evidence from insomnia trials is promising
- Lemborexant showed sustained improvements in sleep and fatigue measures
- Recommends controlled trials combining orexin modulators with behavioral approaches
- Advocates precision medicine framework: orexin profiling + multi-omics + machine learning

## Methodology

**Study Type:** Integrative literature review
**Studies Reviewed:** 27 studies on orexin system in ME/CFS
**Scope:** Orexin-A and orexin-B levels, hypothalamic dysfunction, therapeutic implications
**Framework:** Precision medicine approach combining pharmacologic and behavioral interventions

## Orexin System Biology

**Function:** Hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) neurons regulate:
- Sleep-wake cycles and arousal
- Autonomic function
- Energy homeostasis
- Stress response
- Motivation and reward

**Receptors:**
- OX1R: Primarily wake-promoting
- OX2R: Both wake promotion and sleep-wake stability

**Clinical Context:** Loss of orexin neurons causes narcolepsy; dysfunction may contribute to ME/CFS symptoms

## Orexin Dysfunction in ME/CFS

**Consistent Findings:**
- **Reduced orexin-A levels** across multiple studies
- **Variable orexin-B responses** - suggests heterogeneity or different disease stages
- Orexin-B identified as "promising candidate biomarker"

**Clinical Implications:**
- Sleep-wake disturbances in ME/CFS may reflect orexinergic dysfunction
- Fatigue and energy dysregulation linked to impaired orexin signaling
- Autonomic dysfunction may partially stem from orexin system impairment
- Cognitive symptoms (arousal, attention) associated with orexin pathways

## Therapeutic Implications: DORAs for ME/CFS

**Current Status:**
- NO clinical trials of orexin modulators specifically in ME/CFS
- Evidence extrapolated from insomnia trials

**Promising Data from Insomnia Research:**
- **Lemborexant** (DORA): Significantly improved Insomnia Severity Index scores and daytime functioning vs placebo
- **Duration:** 12-month study showed sustained benefits
- **Parameters:** Improved sleep-onset latency, wake-after-sleep-onset, AND fatigue measures
- **Mechanism:** DORAs reduce wakefulness without CNS depression

**Author's Recommendation:**
"Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) may ameliorate sleep-wake and fatigue symptoms common to ME/CFS, supporting the rationale for targeted clinical trials in this population."

## Precision Medicine Framework

**Proposed Approach:**
1. **Orexin profiling** - measure orexin-A and orexin-B as biomarkers
2. **Multi-omics integration** - combine with other biomarkers (immune, metabolic, etc.)
3. **Machine learning** - identify patient subgroups likely to respond to orexin modulation
4. **Combined interventions** - pharmacologic (DORAs) + behavioral (CBT, pacing)

**Goal:** Identify which ME/CFS patients will benefit from orexin-targeted therapies

## Clinical Trial Recommendations

**Study Design Needed:**
- Controlled trials of orexin receptor modulators in ME/CFS
- Combination with behavioral approaches (CBT-I, activity pacing)
- Biomarker-guided patient selection (orexin profiling)
- Long-term follow-up (sustained benefits)

**Endpoints:**
- Sleep quality and architecture
- Daytime fatigue severity
- Cognitive function
- Autonomic symptoms
- Overall functional capacity

## Certainty Assessment

**Study Quality:** Medium-High
- Integrative review of 27 studies
- Published in peer-reviewed neuroprotection journal
- Academic editor: Janez Mavri, National Institute of Chemistry, Slovenia
- Recent publication (August 2025) - current evidence base

**Evidence Base:**
- Orexin-A reduction: High consistency across studies
- Orexin-B as biomarker: Moderate (variable responses)
- DORA efficacy in ME/CFS: Low (no direct trials yet)
- DORA efficacy in insomnia: High (multiple RCTs)

**Conflicts of Interest:** None disclosed

**Limitations:**
- No clinical trials of DORAs in ME/CFS (recommendation based on rationale)
- Heterogeneity in orexin-B findings (may reflect disease subtypes)
- Biomarker validation needed before clinical use
- Mechanism linking orexin dysfunction to ME/CFS pathology incompletely understood

**Overall Certainty:**
- Orexin dysfunction in ME/CFS: MEDIUM-HIGH
- DORA therapeutic potential: MEDIUM (strong rationale, no direct evidence)
- Need for trials: HIGH (clear gap, feasible intervention)

## Patient Relevance

**Direct Relevance to Patient's Use of Daridorexant:**

This review provides ME/CFS-specific rationale for using DORAs (including daridorexant) for sleep disturbances in ME/CFS:

1. **Mechanistic Basis:** ME/CFS patients have demonstrated orexin-A reduction - targeting orexin system addresses underlying pathology, not just symptoms

2. **Symptom Match:** DORAs improve both sleep AND fatigue measures - addressing two core ME/CFS symptoms

3. **Safety Profile:** DORAs avoid CNS depression that could worsen existing fatigue/cognitive dysfunction

4. **Clinical Trial Priority:** Author advocates for DORA trials in ME/CFS - patient's use represents informed off-label application ahead of formal trials

**Precision Medicine Context:** Patient's successful use of daridorexant 25mg supports hypothesis that some ME/CFS patients (those with orexinergic dysfunction) respond well to DORA therapy. If orexin profiling becomes available, patient may be candidate for biomarker-guided optimization.
