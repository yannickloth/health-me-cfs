**DOI:** 10.1016/j.autneu.2021.103021
**PMID:** 35183906

## Key Points

- Comprehensive review of taVNS for postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
- Includes both acute and chronic intervention studies with controls
- Provides mechanistic data on anti-inflammatory and autonomic effects
- Identifies patient subgroup most likely to respond (low baseline vagal tone)
- POTS shares substantial overlap with ME/CFS (common comorbidity, autonomic dysfunction)
- Demonstrates feasibility of home-based neuromodulation therapy

## Methodology

**Study Type:** Narrative review synthesizing multiple taVNS studies in POTS

### Acute Study (Diedrich et al., 2018)
**Design:** Randomized crossover trial
- n=14 POTS patients (mean age 31±12 years)
- Active taVNS vs sham during head-up tilt testing
- Primary outcome: Tilt test tolerance time

### Chronic Study (Shiffer et al., 2019)
**Design:** Open-label intervention
- n=9 hyperadrenergic POTS patients
- Protocol: 1-hour stimulation blocks, 4× daily, 14 days
- Outcome measure: COMPASS-31 (autonomic symptom questionnaire)

### taVNS Protocol Parameters

**Stimulation Site:** Right auricular branch of vagus nerve (cymba conchae)

**Parameters:**
- Frequency: 25-50 Hz
- Pulse width: 200-300 microseconds
- Current: 0.2-1.8 mA (subsensory to maximal tolerated)
- Duty cycle: 30 seconds on/off cycles
- Duration: 5-minute acute blocks; 4 hours daily chronic

## Results

### Acute Effects
- **Tilt time:** Significant improvement (+5.3±2.6 min, p=0.0156)
- **Heart rate:** Non-significant R-R interval prolongation
- **Symptoms:** Reduced orthostatic symptom scores

### Chronic Effects (2 weeks)
- **COMPASS-31 total score:** Statistically significant reduction (p<0.05)
- **Orthostatic intolerance domain:** Significant reduction (p<0.05)
- **GI symptom domain:** Significant reduction (p<0.05)
- **Secretomotor symptoms:** Lower in active vs control at 2 months

### Mechanistic Biomarkers

**Anti-inflammatory Effects:**
- Significant decrease in β1-adrenergic receptor autoantibody activity
- Significant decrease in α1-AR autoantibody activity
- Serum TNF-α levels significantly decreased (active vs sham)

**Autonomic Function:**
- Heart rate variability changes suggesting improved autonomic balance
- Smaller LF/HF ratio change during postural transition
- Responders had low baseline vagal modulation (HF <200 ms²)

**Cholinergic Pathway:**
- Activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on splenic macrophages
- Vagal activation reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production
- Modulation of brain regions: locus coeruleus, thalamus, prefrontal cortex

## Limitations

1. **Small sample sizes:** n=14 (acute), n=9 (chronic)
2. **Chronic study lacked sham control:** Cannot rule out placebo in chronic effects
3. **Heterogeneity:** POTS subtypes may respond differently
4. **Limited inflammatory marker data:** Only 3 studies assessed cytokines
5. **Short duration:** 2-week chronic intervention; no long-term follow-up
6. **Patient selection:** Hyperadrenergic POTS subset only in chronic study

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Medium (includes randomized crossover but also open-label studies)
- **Sample Size:** Small (n=9-14)
- **Replication:** Multiple studies but same research group
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not explicitly stated
- **Evidence Level:** Moderate for acute effects; lower for chronic effects (no sham control)

## Clinical Implications

**POTS Treatment:**
- taVNS shows promise for POTS, particularly in patients with low baseline vagal tone
- Non-invasive, home-based intervention with good tolerability
- Both symptom improvement and mechanistic biomarker changes observed

**ME/CFS Relevance:**
- POTS is highly prevalent in ME/CFS (~30-40% comorbidity)
- Shared autonomic dysfunction mechanisms
- Anti-inflammatory effects relevant to ME/CFS pathophysiology
- Provides mechanistic rationale for taVNS in ME/CFS (lacking in Natelson 2022)

**Patient Selection:**
- Baseline autonomic testing (HRV) may identify responders
- Low vagal tone (HF <200 ms²) predicts better response
- Consider in ME/CFS patients with documented autonomic dysfunction

## Integration Points

### Chapter: Autonomic Dysfunction
- Could support: Vagal modulation as therapeutic strategy
- Cites as: **achievement** (controlled trial with positive results)
- Mechanistic data on autonomic rebalancing

### Chapter: Immune Dysfunction / Inflammation
- Could support: Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in ME/CFS
- Cites as: **hypothesis** (mechanism from POTS, extrapolated to ME/CFS)
- Autoantibody reduction as therapeutic target

### Chapter: Treatment Approaches
- Could support: taVNS for ME/CFS with comorbid POTS
- Cites as: **achievement** (for POTS); **hypothesis** (for ME/CFS)
- Safety and feasibility data

### Chapter: Biomarkers
- Could support: Baseline HRV as predictor of treatment response
- Cites as: **observation** (post-hoc subgroup finding)
- Requires prospective validation
