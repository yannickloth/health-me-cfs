ABSTRACT:
Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is characterized by orthostatic intolerance due to autonomic dysfunction. This study evaluated transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) as a treatment for POTS through both acute and chronic protocols.

Acute Study (Diedrich et al., 2018): Randomized crossover design in 14 POTS patients comparing taVNS vs sham during head-up tilt testing. taVNS significantly improved tilt time (Δ +5.3±2.6 min, p=0.0156) and reduced orthostatic symptom scores.

Chronic Study (Shiffer et al., 2019): Open-label design with 9 hyperadrenergic POTS patients receiving 1-hour stimulation blocks, 4 times daily, for 14 days. Significant reductions in orthostatic intolerance (p<0.05) and gastrointestinal symptoms (p<0.05) on COMPASS-31 scores.

Mechanistic Findings: taVNS effects appear mediated through:
1. Activation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
2. Reduction of β1-adrenergic receptor and α1-AR autoantibodies
3. Decreased serum TNF-α levels (significant in active vs sham)
4. Improved autonomic balance (HRV changes)
5. Patients with low baseline vagal modulation (HF <200 ms²) showed significant response

The review concludes that taVNS, a low-cost, low-risk intervention, may result in significant amelioration of POTS in selected patients. Mechanisms involve both autonomic rebalancing and anti-inflammatory effects through vagal-immune pathways.
