**Authors:** Natelson BH, Vu T, Mao X, Soto O, Stegner A, Yamamoto Y, Scherl E, Togo F, Lange G
**Journal:** medRxiv (preprint), 2022
**DOI:** 10.1101/2022.11.08.22281807
**PMID:** N/A (preprint)

## Key Points

- First pilot study of tVNS specifically for Long COVID patients meeting ME/CFS criteria
- 57% response rate (8/14 patients) exceeded pre-specified success threshold of 33%
- Open-label design (no sham control) limits causal interpretation
- No adverse effects reported during 6-week treatment period
- Device donated by manufacturer (Parasym); study supported by patient donations

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Open-label pilot study, single-arm intervention

**Population:**
- 16 enrolled, 14 completed
- All met 1994 CFS case definition criteria
- Required ≥6 months fatigue with substantial activity reduction
- Plus substantial problems in ≥3 of: sore throat, tender lymph nodes, headache, muscle/joint pain, brain fog, post-exertional malaise

**Intervention Protocol:**
- Device: Parasym tVNS device
- Placement: Left tragus (auricular branch of vagus nerve)
- Duration: ≥35 minutes daily for 6 weeks
- Intensity: Patient-adjusted to just below discomfort threshold
- No standardized stimulation parameters reported (frequency, pulse width)

**Outcome Measures:**

*Primary:* Success = improvement on ≥2 of:
1. SF-36 Physical Function subscale (≥14% improvement)
2. Symptom severity VAS (≥2-point reduction)
3. Loss of "fatigue case" status on Chalder Fatigue Scale
4. Patient Global Impression of Change (+2 or +3)

*Secondary:*
- Profile of Mood States (≥10-point improvement)

## Results

**Primary Outcome:** 8/14 patients (57%) achieved success criteria

**Statistical Significance:** Exceeded pre-specified threshold (≥33% response rate for pilot success)

**Safety:** Zero adverse effects reported

**Comparison to Placebo:** Authors note typical placebo response in ME/CFS trials is ~24%, suggesting observed 57% response may exceed placebo effect

## Limitations

1. **No sham control:** Cannot rule out placebo effect
2. **Open-label design:** Expectancy bias possible
3. **Small sample:** n=14 completers
4. **Lack of parameter standardization:** Patient-adjusted intensity, no frequency/pulse width specified
5. **Funding/device:** Potential bias from manufacturer device donation
6. **Follow-up:** No data on durability of response after treatment cessation
7. **Preprint status:** Not peer-reviewed at time of publication

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Low to Medium (open-label pilot, small n, no sham control)
- **Sample Size:** n=14 (very small)
- **Replication:** Single study, no independent replication
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Device donated by manufacturer; study funded by patient donations
- **Evidence Level:** Preliminary/exploratory; requires controlled validation

## Clinical Implications

- Suggests potential benefit of tVNS for Long COVID-CFS subset
- 57% response rate clinically meaningful if confirmed in controlled trials
- Low-cost, low-risk intervention suitable for further investigation
- Need for sham-controlled RCT with standardized parameters
- Current evidence insufficient for clinical recommendation

## Integration Points

### Chapter: Treatment Approaches (Experimental/Emerging)
- Could support: tVNS as investigational treatment for ME/CFS
- Cites as: **hypothesis** (preliminary evidence, needs validation)
- Note limitations and preliminary nature

### Chapter: Autonomic Dysfunction
- Could support: Vagal modulation as therapeutic target
- Cites as: **speculation** (mechanism inferred, not directly measured)

### Chapter: Post-Viral ME/CFS / Long COVID
- Could support: Shared pathophysiology between Long COVID and classic ME/CFS
- Cites as: **observation** (patient selection criteria)
