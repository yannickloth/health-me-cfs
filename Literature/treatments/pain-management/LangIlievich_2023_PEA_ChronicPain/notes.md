**Journal:** Nutrients, 2023, Vol. 15(6), Article 1350

**DOI:** 10.3390/nu15061350

**Study Type:** Systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind RCTs

## Key Points

- PEA significantly reduces chronic pain across multiple pain types (nociceptive, neuropathic, nociplastic)
- Effect size: Standard mean difference of 1.68 on 11-point pain scale (p < 0.00001)
- 9 of 11 studies showed significant analgesic benefit favoring PEA
- Excellent safety profile: 6 studies reported no adverse effects, 3 showed no difference from placebo
- Dosing range: 300-1200 mg daily, administered once or twice daily
- No clear dose-response relationship identified

## Methodology

**Design:** PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis
**Inclusion criteria:** Double-blind randomized controlled trials of oral PEA for chronic pain
**Sample size:** 11 studies, 774 total participants (383 PEA, 391 control)
**Pain conditions studied:** Various chronic pain types including neuropathic, inflammatory, and nociplastic pain
**Duration:** Treatment durations varied across studies
**Outcome measures:** Pain reduction (primary), adverse effects (secondary)

## Mechanisms of Action (from review)

- Anti-inflammatory properties via PPAR-α activation
- Endocannabinoid system modulation (indirect CB receptor effects)
- Mast cell stabilization
- Reduction of neuroinflammation

## Clinical Findings

### Efficacy
- Significant pain reduction at 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and 24-26 weeks
- Benefits observed across all pain types studied
- Both 300 mg and 600 mg daily dosing produced significant effects
- No clear dose-response relationship established

### Safety
- Minimal adverse effects reported
- Most common: mild, transient gastrointestinal symptoms (in only 1 of 11 studies)
- No serious adverse events attributed to PEA
- Favorable safety profile compared to traditional analgesics

## Certainty Assessment

**Study Quality:** High (systematic review of RCTs with meta-analysis)
**Sample Size:** Moderate (n=774 across 11 studies, individual studies small)
**Heterogeneity:** High (I² = 93%) - limits strength of conclusions
**Replication:** Multiple independent RCTs support efficacy
**Conflicts of Interest:** Not specified in extracted data
**Publication Type:** Peer-reviewed journal (Nutrients)

**Overall Certainty:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- Strong evidence from multiple RCTs
- High heterogeneity reduces certainty
- Consistent safety findings
- Dosing optimization needed

## Limitations

1. High heterogeneity (I² = 93%) regarding indications, dosages, and treatment duration
2. Most individual trials were small
3. Optimal dosing parameters undefined
4. Optimal treatment duration unclear
5. Clinical significance of numerical pain improvements requires validation
6. Limited to oral PEA formulations
7. Varying formulations (micronized, ultramicronized) not systematically compared

## Relevance to ME/CFS

**Direct relevance:** Moderate
- ME/CFS patients frequently experience chronic pain
- Pain mechanisms in ME/CFS may involve neuroinflammation (PEA target)
- Safety profile suitable for patients with multiple sensitivities
- No specific ME/CFS studies included in this meta-analysis

**Indirect relevance:** High
- Anti-inflammatory mechanism relevant to ME/CFS pathophysiology
- Mast cell stabilization may benefit suspected MCAS in ME/CFS
- Endocannabinoid system dysfunction implicated in ME/CFS
- May address pain without opioid risks

## Clinical Implications

1. PEA represents evidence-based option for chronic pain management
2. Favorable safety profile makes it suitable for long-term use
3. May reduce reliance on opioid analgesics
4. Dosing flexibility (300-1200 mg/day) allows individualization
5. 400 mg dosing (patient's current regimen) falls within effective range
6. Micronized/ultramicronized formulations preferred for bioavailability

## Integration Points

### Appendix J: Treatment Recommendations
- Add PEA to pain management options
- Note evidence quality: multiple RCTs, meta-analysis support
- Specify dosing: 300-1200 mg/day, typically 400-600 mg BID
- Emphasize safety profile
- Note time to effect: 6-8 weeks for full benefit

### Chapter on Symptom Management (if exists)
- Include in pain management strategies
- Compare to other analgesic options
- Note anti-inflammatory mechanism
- Discuss patient tolerance considerations

### Formalization potential
- Mechanism could be formalized: PPAR-α activation → NF-κB inhibition → reduced inflammatory cytokines
- Clinical evidence supports hypothesis/achievement environment
- Dosing uncertainty warrants caution environment if making specific recommendations
