**Journal:** PLoS One, 2024 Jul 23;19(7):e0307484

**DOI:** 10.1371/journal.pone.0307484

**PMID:** 39042627

## Key Points

- Long-term (6-year) follow-up of RituxME (n=151) and CycloME (n=40) trials
- **Rituximab:** No long-term benefit over placebo (rituximab 27.6% with SF-36 PF ≥70 vs placebo 20.4%)
- **Cyclophosphamide:** Intriguing results with 44.1% achieving SF-36 PF ≥70, but NOT recommended due to toxicity
- Authors emphasize cyclophosphamide should ONLY be used in clinical trials
- Suggests possible immune-mediated subgroup, but mechanism unclear

## Methodology

- **Design:** Long-term observational follow-up of two earlier trials
  - RituxME: Phase III RCT (rituximab vs placebo)
  - CycloME: Phase II open-label (cyclophosphamide)
- **Follow-up:** 6 years post-treatment
- **Participation rate:** RituxME 75.7%, CycloME 94.4%
- **Outcome measures:** SF-36 Physical Function (SF-36 PF), DePaul Short Form (DSQ-SF)

## Results Summary

### RituxME Rituximab Group (n=58 at 6 years)
- SF-36 PF: 32.9 (baseline) → 42.4 (18mo) → 45.5 (6yr)
- Improved ≥70: 27.6%
- Improved ≥90 (normal): 8.6%
- Worsened ≥20 points: 10.3%

### RituxME Placebo Group (n=54 at 6 years)
- SF-36 PF: 32.3 (baseline) → 45.5 (18mo) → 43.1 (6yr)
- Improved ≥70: 20.4%
- Improved ≥90 (normal): 7.4%
- Worsened ≥20 points: 14.8%

**Rituximab vs Placebo interpretation:** Minimal difference (27.6% vs 20.4% with PF≥70) - NOT statistically significant and doesn't justify toxic therapy

### CycloME Cyclophosphamide Group (n=34 at 6 years)
- SF-36 PF: 35.4 (baseline) → 54.4 (18mo) → 56.7 (6yr)
- Improved ≥70: 44.1%
- Improved ≥90 (normal): 17.6%
- Worsened ≥20 points: 5.9%

**Key caveat:** Open-label design, no placebo control, small sample

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

### Treatment Chapter
1. **Rituximab:** Confirms long-term lack of benefit (cite with Fluge 2019)
2. **Cyclophosphamide:** Intriguing but NOT recommended outside trials
3. **Immune modulation:** Supports heterogeneity hypothesis (possible immune subgroup)

### Prognosis Chapter
- Natural history data from placebo group
- ~20% improve substantially even without specific treatment
- ~15% worsen significantly over 6 years

### Research Directions
- Need for biomarker-driven patient stratification
- Search for less toxic immune modulators
- Importance of identifying true responder subgroups

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** MODERATE
  - RituxME: Original trial was high-quality RCT, follow-up is observational
  - CycloME: Open-label, no placebo control (LOW quality for efficacy claims)
- **Sample Size:** RituxME adequate (n=112 at 6yr), CycloME small (n=34)
- **Replication:** Rituximab confirmed negative; cyclophosphamide NOT replicated
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Publicly funded
- **Limitations:**
  - CycloME lacks placebo control (huge limitation!)
  - Loss to follow-up (24% in RituxME)
  - Selection bias (responders more likely to continue)
  - Self-reported outcomes

## Critical Analysis: Cyclophosphamide Findings

### Why the positive results are uncertain:

1. **No placebo control** - RituxME placebo group showed 20% improved to PF≥70, CycloME showed 44%, but different trials/populations
2. **Open-label bias** - Patients and doctors knew treatment
3. **Small sample** - n=34 at follow-up
4. **Selection bias** - 94% participation may favor responders
5. **Natural fluctuation** - ME/CFS has spontaneous improvement
6. **Regression to mean** - Patients enrolled at worst may improve anyway

### Why it's still interesting:

1. Larger effect size (44% vs 20% in RituxME placebo)
2. More patients reached normal function (17.6% vs 7.4%)
3. Fewer patients worsened (5.9% vs 14.8%)
4. Sustained improvement at 6 years (not just transient)

### Conclusion:
Hypothesis-generating ONLY. Requires placebo-controlled RCT before any clinical use. Cyclophosphamide toxicity (cancer risk, infertility) is too high without definitive evidence.

> "After six years, 44.1% of the cyclophosphamide group scored an SF-36 PF of at least 70, and 17.6% of at least 90, suggesting that cyclophosphamide in a subgroup may modulate the disease course in a beneficial way." (p. 1)

> "However, cyclophosphamide carries toxicity concerns and should not be used for ME/CFS patients outside clinical trials." (p. 1) **[CRITICAL QUOTE - always include]**

> "These data should encourage efforts to better understand the disease mechanisms and to search for targeted and less toxic immune modulatory treatment for this patient group." (p. 1)
