# Rekeland et al. (2024) - 6-Year Follow-up of Rituximab and Cyclophosphamide Trials

## Summary

Long-term follow-up study showing:
1. **Rituximab:** No sustained benefit (confirms 2019 negative trial)
2. **Cyclophosphamide:** Intriguing open-label results BUT not recommended due to toxicity and lack of placebo control
3. **Natural history:** ~20% improve, ~15% worsen over 6 years without specific treatment

Rekeland IG, Sørland K, Neteland LL, et al. Six-year follow-up of participants in two clinical trials of rituximab or cyclophosphamide in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. *PLoS One*. 2024;19(7):e0307484. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0307484

## Key Results

- **Rituximab:** 27.6% improved (SF-36 PF ≥70) vs 20.4% placebo
- **Cyclophosphamide:** 44.1% improved (but no placebo control!)
- **Authors' warning:** "cyclophosphamide...should not be used for ME/CFS patients outside clinical trials"

## Why This Matters

1. **Confirms rituximab failure** long-term
2. **Cyclophosphamide is hypothesis-generating only** - open-label, no placebo
3. **Natural history data** from placebo group valuable
4. **Supports heterogeneity** - possible immune subgroup

## Certainty Assessment

### Rituximab data: HIGH
- Follow-up of rigorous RCT
- Confirms negative results

### Cyclophosphamide data: LOW
- No placebo control
- Open-label bias
- Small sample

## Critical Note

**MUST emphasize:** Cyclophosphamide should NOT be used clinically. Authors explicitly warn against use outside trials. Severe toxicity (cancer, infertility, infections) not justified by uncertain open-label data.
