# Fluge et al. (2019) - Rituximab Phase III Trial for ME/CFS

## Summary

**CRITICAL NEGATIVE TRIAL** - High-quality phase III RCT demonstrating rituximab is ineffective for ME/CFS.

## Citation

Fluge Ø, Rekeland IG, Lien K, et al. B-Lymphocyte Depletion in Patients With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial. *Ann Intern Med*. 2019;170(9):585-593. doi:10.7326/M18-1451

## Key Result

**NO BENEFIT** - Rituximab 26% response vs Placebo 35% response (P=0.22)

## Why This Matters

1. **Definitively refutes** B-cell depletion as ME/CFS treatment
2. **Contradicts earlier studies** showing this is why phase III trials are essential
3. **High placebo response (35%)** shows need for rigorous controls
4. **Significant toxicity** without benefit = harmful treatment
