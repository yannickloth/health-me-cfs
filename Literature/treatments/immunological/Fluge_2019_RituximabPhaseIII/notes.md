**Journal:** Annals of Internal Medicine, 2019 May 7;170(9):585-593

**DOI:** 10.7326/M18-1451

**PMID:** 30934066

## Key Points

- **NEGATIVE TRIAL**: Rituximab showed NO benefit over placebo for ME/CFS
- Response rate was actually LOWER in rituximab group (26.0%) vs placebo (35.1%), though not statistically significant
- No difference in fatigue scores, physical function, or any secondary outcomes over 24 months
- Higher serious adverse event rate in rituximab group (26.0% vs 18.9%)
- This contradicted promising earlier Phase II results

## Methodology

- **Design:** Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial
- **Sample:** 151 patients (77 rituximab, 74 placebo)
- **Inclusion:** ME/CFS by Canadian consensus criteria, disease duration 2-15 years, age 18-65
- **Setting:** 5 Norwegian hospitals
- **Treatment:** Rituximab 500 mg/m² × 2 (weeks 0 and 2), then 500 mg × 4 (months 3, 6, 9, 12)
- **Follow-up:** 24 months
- **Primary outcome:** Response rate (fatigue score ≥4.5 for ≥8 consecutive weeks)

## Results Summary

### Primary Outcomes
- **Response rate:** Placebo 35.1% vs Rituximab 26.0% (difference: 9.2 percentage points, P=0.22)
- **Fatigue score:** No difference over 24 months (P=0.80)

### Secondary Outcomes
- No differences in SF-36 scores
- No differences in Fatigue Severity Scale
- No differences in physical activity levels
- No differences in self-reported function

### Safety
- Serious adverse events: Rituximab 26.0% vs Placebo 18.9%
- Rituximab carries known risks: infections, infusion reactions, potential malignancy

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

**CRITICAL for treatment chapter** - This is a landmark NEGATIVE trial that:
1. Disproves autoimmune B-cell hypothesis as universal mechanism
2. Shows dangers of extrapolating from small open-label studies
3. Demonstrates placebo response in ME/CFS trials (~35%)
4. Argues AGAINST rituximab use in ME/CFS

Must be cited prominently in treatment sections to warn against this failed therapy.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** HIGH (phase III RCT, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, published in Annals of Internal Medicine)
- **Sample Size:** n=151 (adequate for phase III)
- **Replication:** This IS the replication - contradicted earlier positive Phase II studies
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Publicly funded (Norwegian Research Council, health trusts, foundations)
- **Limitations:** Self-reported outcomes, possible heterogeneity in ME/CFS population

## Why Earlier Studies Were Misleading

Previous open-label and small Phase II trials (Fluge & Mella 2011-2015) showed promising results, but:
- Small sample sizes (n=15-30)
- Open-label or inadequate blinding
- Selected patient populations
- Publication bias
- Natural disease fluctuation mistaken for treatment effect

## Clinical Implications

**RITUXIMAB SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ME/CFS**

This high-quality negative trial definitively shows:
1. No benefit over placebo
2. Significant toxicity risk
3. High cost
4. No mechanistic justification

## Integration Points

### Chapter on Failed Treatments
- PRIMARY citation for rituximab failure
- Use `warning` environment about autoimmune therapies

### Chapter on Treatment Principles
- Example of failed drug repurposing
- Importance of rigorous RCTs before adoption

### Pathophysiology Chapter
- Evidence AGAINST simple autoimmune B-cell hypothesis
- May support heterogeneity (possible small subset responds?)

### Appendix: Clinical Trial Lessons
- Case study in translational failure
- Placebo response rates in ME/CFS
