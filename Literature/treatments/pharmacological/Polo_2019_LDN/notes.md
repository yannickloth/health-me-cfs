**Authors:** Olli Polo, Pia Pesonen, Essi Tuominen

**Journal:** Fatigue: Biomedicine, Health & Behavior, 2019;7(4):207-217

**DOI:** 10.1080/21641846.2019.1692770

**Type:** Retrospective chart review (observational study)

## Key Points

- **Large sample:** n=218 ME/CFS patients treated with LDN
- **High response rate:** 73.9% reported subjective improvement
- **Well-tolerated:** Mild transient side effects only (insomnia, nausea)
- **MAJOR LIMITATION:** No placebo control, retrospective, subjective outcomes
- **Authors acknowledge:** "placebo-controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings"

## Methodology

### Design
- **Type:** Retrospective chart review
- **Setting:** Unesta Sleep and Breathing Center, Tampere, Finland
- **Period:** Patients treated 2010-2014, retrospectively reviewed
- **Sample:** 218 patients with ME/CFS diagnosis
- **Inclusion:** ME/CFS diagnosis + LDN treatment prescribed
- **Exclusion:** Not clearly specified (selection bias concern)

### Treatment
- **Drug:** Naltrexone at low dose
- **Dose:** 3.0 - 4.5 mg/day (typical LDN range)
- **Duration:** Variable (mean follow-up 1.7 years)
- **Administration:** Oral, typically at bedtime

### Outcomes
- **Primary:** Patient-reported subjective improvement
- **Domains assessed:**
  - Vigilance/alertness
  - Physical performance
  - Cognitive function
  - Muscle aches
  - GI symptoms
- **Response definition:** Self-reported improvement (any degree)

### Data Collection
- Baseline questionnaire
- Follow-up visits (frequency not specified)
- Chart review by investigators

## Results Summary

### Response Rates (n=218, 92.2% with outcome data)
- **Overall positive response:** 73.9% (n=161)
- **Vigilance/alertness improved:** 51.4%
- **Physical performance improved:** 23.9%
- **Cognitive function improved:** 21.1%
- **No response or worsened:** 26.1%

### Adverse Effects
- **Mild AEs common initially:** Insomnia, nausea
- **Transient:** Resolved with continued treatment
- **No severe AEs reported**
- **No long-term AEs reported**

### Follow-up
- **Mean duration:** 1.7 years
- **Data completeness:** 92.2% (good for retrospective study)

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

### Treatment Chapter: LDN as Experimental Therapy
- Promising observational data
- REQUIRES placebo-controlled RCT for validation
- Well-tolerated, low risk
- May be worth considering for patients who have failed other treatments

### Evidence Quality Considerations
- Retrospective = LOW evidence level
- No placebo control = cannot distinguish treatment effect from:
  - Placebo response
  - Natural disease fluctuation
  - Regression to mean
  - Reporting bias
- BUT: Large sample, high response rate, sustained benefit

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** LOW-MODERATE
  - Retrospective (weak design)
  - No placebo control (critical flaw)
  - Subjective outcomes only
  - Selection bias (who got LDN prescribed?)
  - BUT: Large sample, good follow-up rate

- **Sample Size:** GOOD (n=218)

- **Replication:** PENDING
  - RCTs are underway/needed
  - Some case reports support findings
  - Mechanistic plausibility (see below)

- **Conflicts of Interest:** UNCLEAR
  - Authors affiliated with sleep center
  - Not disclosed if LDN prescribed for profit
  - No pharmaceutical funding mentioned

- **Limitations:**
  1. **NO PLACEBO CONTROL** (disqualifying for efficacy claims)
  2. Retrospective design
  3. Subjective outcomes (no objective measures)
  4. Selection bias (who got prescribed LDN?)
  5. Unclear response criteria ("any improvement")
  6. No validated outcome scales (SF-36, etc.)
  7. No standardization of dose or duration
  8. Finland-specific population (generalizability?)

## Mechanism of Action: Why LDN Might Work

### Proposed Mechanisms
1. **Opioid receptor modulation:**
   - Low-dose naltrexone briefly blocks opioid receptors
   - Leads to upregulation of endogenous opioid production
   - May modulate pain and inflammation

2. **Immune modulation:**
   - May reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines
   - Potentially affects glial cell activation
   - Could modulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs)

3. **Endorphin enhancement:**
   - Rebound increase in endorphins after brief blockade
   - May improve mood, energy, pain

4. **Anti-inflammatory effects:**
   - Shown in other conditions (Crohn's, MS)
   - May reduce neuroinflammation

**NOTE:** Mechanisms are speculative for ME/CFS specifically.

## Critical Analysis

### Why this study is encouraging:
1. **Large sample** (n=218)
2. **High response rate** (73.9%)
3. **Sustained benefit** (mean 1.7 years follow-up)
4. **Low side effects** (mild, transient)
5. **Affordable drug** (generic naltrexone)
6. **Authors call for RCT** (scientific integrity)

### Why we can't conclude efficacy:
1. **No placebo control** - Rituximab trial showed 35% placebo response!
2. **Retrospective bias** - Patients/doctors chose LDN (selection)
3. **Subjective outcomes** - "Any improvement" is vague
4. **Publication bias** - Negative retrospective studies not published
5. **Regression to mean** - Patients may improve naturally
6. **Expectation effects** - Patients hoped for benefit

### What this study CAN tell us:
1. LDN is **safe** in ME/CFS (no serious AEs)
2. LDN is **tolerable** (mild transient AEs only)
3. LDN is **worth studying in RCT**
4. Some patients **believe they improved** (whether due to drug or placebo)

### What this study CANNOT tell us:
1. Whether LDN is **effective** (need placebo control)
2. What **dose is optimal**
3. Which **patients respond** (biomarkers?)
4. How LDN **compares to other treatments**

## Integration Points

### Chapter: Emerging Pharmacological Treatments

```latex
\begin{hypothesis}[Low-Dose Naltrexone Efficacy]
\label{hyp:ldn-efficacy}
A large retrospective study (n=218) reported subjective improvement in 73.9\% of ME/CFS patients treated with low-dose naltrexone (3.0-4.5 mg/day), with particular benefit for vigilance and alertness~\cite{Polo2019}.
However, the lack of placebo control and retrospective design preclude definitive conclusions about efficacy.
Placebo-controlled RCTs are essential to determine whether LDN provides benefit beyond placebo response.
\end{hypothesis}

\begin{observation}[LDN Safety Profile]
\label{obs:ldn-safety}
In a cohort of 218 ME/CFS patients treated with low-dose naltrexone over a mean of 1.7 years, no severe adverse effects were reported~\cite{Polo2019}.
Mild transient side effects (insomnia, nausea) were common initially but resolved with continued treatment.
\end{observation}
```

### Chapter: Treatment Principles

Example of promising observational data requiring RCT validation before adoption.

### Chapter: Off-Label Medications

LDN as example of drug repurposing based on:
- Anecdotal reports
- Mechanistic plausibility
- Good safety profile
- But still requiring rigorous testing

### Appendix: Medications Awaiting RCT Evidence

Detailed discussion of LDN mechanism, observational evidence, ongoing trials.

## Ongoing/Needed Research

### RCTs in Progress (as of 2026):
- Search for completed/ongoing LDN RCTs in ME/CFS
- May provide definitive evidence by now

### Key Research Questions:
1. Does LDN beat placebo in blinded RCT?
2. What dose is optimal (1.5mg vs 3mg vs 4.5mg)?
3. Which patients respond (biomarkers)?
4. What is mechanism in ME/CFS specifically?
5. How does LDN compare to other treatments?
6. Does LDN work for all severity levels?

## Clinical Implications (Current)

### Should LDN be used for ME/CFS?

**Not as standard treatment** - insufficient evidence

**Possibly for selected patients:**
- Failed other treatments
- Informed consent about limited evidence
- Close monitoring
- Low risk given safety profile
- Inexpensive (generic drug)

**Shared decision-making:**
- Explain: observational data, no RCT proof
- Discuss: 74% responded in open-label study, but 35% placebo response seen in trials
- Acknowledge: we don't know if it truly works
- Consider: trial of LDN if patient interested, fully informed

## Comparison to Rituximab Story

### Similarities:
- Both showed promise in early open-label studies
- Both had high "response rates" in uncontrolled settings
- Both moved to rigorous RCT testing
- Both have proposed immune mechanisms

### Differences:
- LDN is much safer (rituximab has serious AEs)
- LDN is much cheaper
- LDN has lower toxicity risk
- LDN retrospective study was larger (218 vs 15-30)

### Key Lesson:
Even 73.9% response rate in observational study doesn't guarantee efficacy (remember 35% placebo response in rituximab trial!). MUST test in RCT.
