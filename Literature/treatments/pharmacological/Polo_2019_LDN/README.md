# Polo et al. (2019) - Low-Dose Naltrexone for ME/CFS

## Summary

Large retrospective study (n=218) showing 73.9% of ME/CFS patients reported improvement with LDN. Well-tolerated, but **NO placebo control** limits interpretation.

## Key Results

- **Response rate:** 73.9% reported subjective improvement
- **Safety:** No serious adverse events in 218 patients over 1.7 years
- **Side effects:** Mild, transient (insomnia, nausea)
- **Authors' conclusion:** "placebo-controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings"

## Why This Matters

1. **Promising signal** - Large response rate, well-tolerated
2. **Requires RCT** - No placebo control = cannot prove efficacy
3. **High priority for testing** - Safe, cheap, mechanistically plausible
4. **Currently used off-label** - Many patients already trying LDN

## Study Design

**MAJOR LIMITATION:** Retrospective chart review with NO placebo control

- Cannot distinguish true drug effect from:
  - Placebo response (35% in rituximab trial!)
  - Natural disease fluctuation
  - Regression to mean
  - Selection bias

## Integration Priority

**MODERATE-HIGH** - Important to discuss as:
- Emerging therapy with preliminary evidence
- Example requiring RCT validation
- Safe option for treatment-refractory patients (with informed consent)
- Contrast to rituximab (both had promising open-label data, rituximab failed RCT)

## Certainty Assessment

### Safety: HIGH
- Large sample, long follow-up
- No serious AEs
- Use `observation` environment

### Efficacy: LOW
- No placebo control
- Retrospective design
- **Use `hypothesis` environment, NOT `observation`**
- **Always mention lack of placebo control**

## Key Messages for Document

1. **Promising but unproven** - Large observational study, awaits RCT
2. **Excellent safety** - No serious AEs in 218 patients
3. **Requires caution** - Rituximab also looked good in early studies, failed RCT
4. **Reasonable to try?** - For treatment-refractory patients with informed consent
5. **High research priority** - Safe, cheap, worth rigorous testing

## Cross-References

Compare/contrast with:
- **Rituximab:** Also promising in open-label, failed in RCT
- **Cyclophosphamide:** Also promising in open-label, too toxic to recommend
- **Placebo response:** 35% in rituximab trial shows need for controls
