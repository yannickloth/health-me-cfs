**Authors:** Helene Cabanas (lead), Katsuhiko Muraki, Natalie Eaton-Fitch, Donald Ross Staines, Sonya Marshall-Gradisnik
**Journal:** Frontiers in Immunology, July 13, 2021
**DOI:** 10.3389/fimmu.2021.687806

## Key Points

- First study demonstrating LDN restores TRPM3 ion channel function in ME/CFS
- Small pilot study (n=9 patients on LDN, n=9 healthy controls)
- Significant improvements in cognition (p=0.004) and immune function (p=0.024)
- Retrospective data shows 73.9% positive response rate to LDN
- Provides mechanistic explanation for LDN efficacy in ME/CFS

## Methodology

**Study Design:**
- Cross-sectional comparison
- 9 ME/CFS patients currently taking LDN
- 9 age/sex-matched healthy controls
- TRPM3 ion channel activity measured via patch-clamp electrophysiology

**LDN Treatment Parameters:**
- Dose range: 3.0-5.0 mg/day
- Mean dose: 4.06 mg/day
- Mean duration: ~21 months
- Dosing: typically at bedtime

**Measurements:**
- TRPM3 channel currents (pregnenolone sulfate stimulation)
- Symptom severity questionnaires
- Cognitive function assessment
- Immune disturbance markers

## Results Summary

**TRPM3 Restoration:**
- ME/CFS patients on LDN showed TRPM3 currents comparable to healthy controls
- Typical TRPM3-like outward rectification observed after PregS application
- Suggests functional restoration of calcium signaling pathway

**Clinical Improvements:**
- Cognitive function: statistically significant improvement (p=0.004)
- Immune disturbances: statistically significant improvement (p=0.024)
- Self-reported symptom improvement in majority of patients

**Response Rate (from cited retrospective study):**
- 73.9% of ME/CFS patients reported positive treatment response
- Well-tolerated with minimal side effects

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

**Mechanistic Insight:**
Provides clear mechanism of action: LDN antagonizes mu-opioid receptors, which removes inhibitory effect on TRPM3 channels. Restored TRPM3 function enables proper calcium signaling in natural killer cells, improving immune function.

**Treatment Implications:**
- One of few treatments with demonstrated mechanism in ME/CFS
- Addresses immune dysfunction at cellular level
- Relatively safe with low side effect profile
- Affordable compared to many experimental therapies

**Biomarker Potential:**
TRPM3 dysfunction could serve as diagnostic biomarker and treatment response predictor.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Medium (peer-reviewed, mechanistic study, small sample)
- **Sample Size:** n=9 (very small pilot study)
- **Replication:** Cited retrospective study (n=large, 73.9% response) provides convergent evidence
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not mentioned in available abstract
- **Limitations:** Small sample, cross-sectional design (not RCT), patient selection bias (only those tolerating LDN)
