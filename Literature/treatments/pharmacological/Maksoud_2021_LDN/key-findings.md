# Key Findings: Low Dose Naltrexone TRPM3 Restoration

## Main Findings

1. **TRPM3 Restoration:** LDN treatment (3-5 mg/day, ~21 months) restored TRPM3 ion channel function in ME/CFS patient NK cells to levels comparable to healthy controls

2. **Significant Clinical Improvements:**
   - Cognitive function: p=0.004
   - Immune disturbances: p=0.024
   - Both statistically significant despite small sample

3. **High Response Rate:** Retrospective data from larger cohort shows 73.9% of ME/CFS patients report positive treatment response

4. **Clear Mechanism:** LDN (mu-opioid receptor antagonist) removes inhibitory effect on TRPM3, restoring calcium signaling critical for NK cell function

## Clinical Implications

- Provides mechanistic rationale for LDN use in ME/CFS
- TRPM3 dysfunction may serve as biomarker for patient selection
- Relatively safe, well-tolerated, affordable treatment option
- Addresses immune dysfunction at cellular level
- May be particularly effective for patients with prominent immune symptoms

## Limitations

- Very small sample (n=9) - pilot study only
- Cross-sectional design (not randomized controlled trial)
- Selection bias: only patients tolerating LDN included
- Cannot determine causality vs. correlation
- Needs larger RCT for confirmation
- Unknown whether TRPM3 restoration is cause or marker of improvement

## Integration Points

### Chapter 7: Immune Dysfunction
- Could support: TRPM3 ion channel dysfunction in NK cells
- Cites as: **hypothesis** (small pilot study, needs replication)

### Chapter 14: Symptom Management / Chapter 18: Emerging Therapies
- Could support: LDN as evidence-based treatment option
- Cites as: **achievement** (demonstrated mechanism) + **warning** (small study, needs RCT)

### Chapter 22: Mechanistic Studies
- Could support: TRPM3 as therapeutic target and biomarker
- Cites as: **observation** (mechanistic finding)
