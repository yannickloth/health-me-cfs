**PMCID:** PMC8313851
**Type:** Mechanistic pilot study

## Summary

This pilot study investigated whether low dose naltrexone (LDN) could restore TRPM3 ion channel function in natural killer cells from ME/CFS patients. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, researchers demonstrated that ME/CFS patients taking LDN (3-5 mg/day for ~21 months) exhibited TRPM3 channel activity comparable to healthy controls.

**Key Mechanism:** LDN acts as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, removing inhibitory effects on TRPM3 channels and restoring calcium signaling critical for NK cell immune function.

**Clinical Outcomes:** Significant improvements in cognitive function (p=0.004) and immune disturbances (p=0.024).

**Response Rate:** A cited retrospective study found 73.9% of ME/CFS patients reported positive treatment response to LDN.

## Clinical Significance

- **Mechanistic validation:** Provides clear biological mechanism for LDN efficacy
- **Therapeutic target:** TRPM3 restoration as treatment goal
- **Biomarker potential:** TRPM3 dysfunction may predict treatment response
- **Safety profile:** Well-tolerated, minimal side effects
- **Accessibility:** Relatively affordable, available via compounding pharmacies

## Limitations

- Very small sample (n=9 patients)
- Cross-sectional design (not RCT)
- Selection bias: only patients tolerating LDN
- Cannot establish causality
- Needs larger confirmatory trials

## Dosing Information

- **Dose range:** 3.0-5.0 mg/day
- **Mean effective dose:** 4.06 mg/day
- **Typical start:** 1.5 mg, titrate up
- **Timing:** Usually bedtime
- **Duration to effect:** Variable (average ~21 months in study, but clinical improvement often seen sooner)
