Soul-Lawton J, Seaber E, On N, Wootton R, Rolan P, Posner J. Multiple interactions of cimetidine and probenecid with valaciclovir and its metabolite acyclovir. *Antimicrob Agents Chemother*. 2001 Dec;45(12):3585-3592. doi: 10.1128/AAC.45.12.3585-3592.2001. PMID: 11796358. PMCID: PMC127018.

## Quick Summary
**Type:** Pharmacokinetic study (controlled)
**Finding:** Cimetidine increases valacyclovir AUC by 73%, acyclovir AUC by 27%
**Mechanism:** Competitive inhibition of membrane transporters (liver/kidney)
**Certainty:** HIGH for pharmacokinetics; extrapolation to clinical benefit uncertain

## Key Quantitative Results
- **Valacyclovir Cmax:** +53% with 800mg cimetidine
- **Valacyclovir AUC:** +73%
- **Acyclovir Cmax:** +8%
- **Acyclovir AUC:** +27%
- **Tolerability:** No adverse effects from interaction

## Mechanism
Multiple sites of interaction:
1. **Intestinal absorption:** Cimetidine affects valacyclovir uptake
2. **Hepatic conversion:** Competition at liver transporters
3. **Renal secretion:** Primary mechanism - inhibits active tubular secretion

## Relevance to ME/CFS
- Provides quantitative basis for Stuijt 2026 clinical observations
- Explains how cimetidine can boost antiviral drug levels
- Supports pharmacokinetic enhancement strategy in treatment failures
- Well-established interaction (controlled study, reproducible)

## Integration Status
- ✅ Literature folder created
- ✅ BibTeX entry added (SoulLawton2001CimetidineValacyclovir)
- ✅ Cited in main integration documents
- ⏳ Detailed notes optional (key data already extracted)

## Role in Literature Set
**Supporting paper** for pharmacokinetic mechanism. Primary clinical papers are Stuijt 2026 (application) and Goldstein 1986 (historical). This paper provides the quantitative pharmacokinetic foundation.

## Notes
This is a well-controlled pharmacokinetic study that establishes the drug interaction mechanism. It's cited as supporting evidence in the main integration guides. Detailed individual notes are less critical since the key quantitative data has been extracted and integrated into the primary papers' documentation.
