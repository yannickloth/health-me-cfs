# Use of Cimetidine to Enhance Acyclovir Concentrations

**Authors:** R. Stuijt et al.
**Journal:** British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, January 2026
**DOI:** 10.1002/bcp.70313
**Publication Type:** Case series

## Key Points
- Cimetidine increases acyclovir plasma levels by inhibiting renal tubular secretion
- Clinical application: patients with recurrent HSV who fail standard valacyclovir therapy
- Mechanism: competitive inhibition of organic cation transporters (OCT2, MATE1)
- Significant clinical improvement achieved with combination therapy
- Represents novel drug repurposing for pharmacokinetic enhancement
- Published January 2026 (most recent evidence on this combination)

## Methodology
**Study Design:** Case series
**Population:** Patients with recurrent herpes simplex virus infections unresponsive to standard suppressive valacyclovir therapy
**Diagnostic Criteria:** Subtherapeutic acyclovir plasma levels confirmed by therapeutic drug monitoring
**Interventions:**
  - Strategy 1: Valacyclovir dose escalation alone
  - Strategy 2: Standard valacyclovir + cimetidine co-administration
**Primary Outcome:** Achievement of therapeutic acyclovir plasma levels
**Secondary Outcome:** Clinical symptom improvement
**Sample Size:** Not specified in available abstract (case series format)

## Pharmacokinetic Mechanism

### Drug Interaction Pathway
1. **Valacyclovir absorption:** Prodrug absorbed in intestine, converted to acyclovir
2. **Renal elimination:** Acyclovir eliminated primarily via kidney:
   - Glomerular filtration
   - Active tubular secretion (OCT2, MATE1 transporters)
3. **Cimetidine inhibition:** Competitively blocks OCT2/MATE1 transporters
4. **Result:** Reduced renal clearance → increased plasma acyclovir levels

### Quantitative Effects (from earlier studies)
- Acyclovir AUC increase: +27% with cimetidine co-administration
- Acyclovir Cmax increase: +8%
- Valacyclovir (prodrug) AUC increase: +73%
- Valacyclovir Cmax increase: +53%

## Clinical Application

### Patient Selection
- Recurrent viral infections (HSV, potentially other herpesviruses)
- Inadequate response to standard-dose suppressive therapy
- Confirmed subtherapeutic drug levels (therapeutic drug monitoring required)
- Consider in ME/CFS patients with suspected viral reactivation unresponsive to antivirals alone

### Treatment Strategies
1. **Dose escalation alone:** Increase valacyclovir dose
2. **Pharmacokinetic enhancement:** Add cimetidine to standard valacyclovir
3. **Combined approach:** Used when dose escalation alone insufficient

### Advantages of Cimetidine Addition
- Avoids very high valacyclovir doses (better tolerability)
- Cost-effective (cimetidine inexpensive, available OTC)
- Well-characterized safety profile
- May be particularly useful in patients with:
  - Poor acyclovir absorption/conversion
  - High renal clearance
  - Inability to tolerate high antiviral doses

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** Low-Medium (case series, no randomization or control group)
- **Sample Size:** Small (exact n not specified in abstract)
- **Replication:** First published report of this specific clinical application (2026)
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not disclosed in abstract
- **Publication Quality:** Peer-reviewed in reputable clinical pharmacology journal
- **Limitations:**
  - Case series design (no controls)
  - Selection bias (only treatment failures reported)
  - No standardized cimetidine dosing protocol reported
  - Unknown generalizability to non-HSV viral infections
  - No long-term safety data for combination
  - Therapeutic drug monitoring required (not widely available)

## Relevance to ME/CFS

### Potential Applications
1. **EBV reactivation:** If mechanism similar to HSV, could enhance valacyclovir efficacy
2. **Treatment failures:** ME/CFS patients on valacyclovir without improvement may have subtherapeutic levels
3. **Pharmacokinetic variability:** ME/CFS patients may have altered drug metabolism/clearance
4. **Cost-effective strategy:** Avoid expensive high-dose antiviral regimens

### Mechanistic Considerations
- **Primary mechanism:** Pharmacokinetic (drug level enhancement)
- **Secondary mechanism:** Immune modulation (H2 receptor blockade) - likely less important
- **Synergistic effects:** Both mechanisms may contribute to clinical benefit

### Clinical Context (Patient Report)
The reported patient case ("got me out of bed" on 200mg cimetidine) could involve:
1. **Pharmacokinetic enhancement:** If on concurrent antiviral, increased drug levels
2. **Immune modulation:** H2 receptor blockade (Goldstein mechanism)
3. **MCAS component:** H2 blockade reducing histamine-mediated symptoms
4. **Combined effects:** Multiple mechanisms contributing to benefit

## Safety Considerations
- Cimetidine generally well-tolerated for short-term use
- Drug interaction potential (CYP450 inhibitor) - see separate safety analysis
- Increased acyclovir levels → potential for increased side effects:
  - CNS effects (confusion, especially in elderly)
  - Nephrotoxicity (ensure adequate hydration)
  - GI disturbance
- Therapeutic drug monitoring recommended when using for this purpose

## Clinical Implementation

### Proposed Protocol (based on available evidence)
1. **Baseline:** Patient failing standard valacyclovir suppressive therapy
2. **Investigation:** Obtain acyclovir plasma levels (if available)
3. **Intervention:** Add cimetidine (dose not specified in abstract; historical data suggests 800mg/day divided)
4. **Monitoring:**
   - Clinical symptom improvement
   - Repeat drug levels if available
   - Monitor for adverse effects
5. **Duration:** Unclear; likely requires continued co-administration

### Research Needs
- Optimal cimetidine dosing for this indication
- Applicability to EBV and other herpesviruses (beyond HSV)
- Long-term safety of combination therapy
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Predictors of response (genetic polymorphisms in transporters?)
- Controlled trial evidence
