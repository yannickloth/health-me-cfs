# Stuijt 2026: Cimetidine Enhancement of Acyclovir Concentrations

## Citation
Stuijt R, et al. Use of cimetidine to enhance systemic acyclovir concentrations in patients with ineffective suppressive therapy for recurring herpes simplex virus infections: A novel purpose for an old drug. *Br J Clin Pharmacol*. 2026 Jan. doi: 10.1002/bcp.70313.

## Quick Summary
**Type:** Case series
**Finding:** Cimetidine increases acyclovir levels, improves HSV treatment outcomes
**Mechanism:** Inhibits renal tubular secretion → higher drug concentrations
**Certainty:** LOW-MEDIUM (case series, very recent, awaiting replication)

- `key-findings.md` - Integration guidance and mechanistic synthesis
- `README.md` - This file

## Key Points
- **Most recent evidence** (January 2026) on cimetidine-antiviral combination
- Pharmacokinetic mechanism distinct from Goldstein's immune hypothesis
- Increases acyclovir AUC by 27%, valacyclovir by 73%
- Clinical benefit demonstrated in treatment-refractory HSV
- Extrapolation to ME/CFS/EBV uncertain but mechanistically plausible

## Relevance to ME/CFS
- May explain antiviral treatment failures (subtherapeutic drug levels)
- Cost-effective strategy to boost valacyclovir efficacy
- Relevant for patients with viral reactivation not responding to antivirals alone
- Requires therapeutic drug monitoring ideally (not widely available)

## Dual Mechanism Hypothesis
**Two independent pathways:**
1. **Pharmacokinetic** (Stuijt 2026): Increases drug levels
2. **Immunomodulatory** (Goldstein 1986): Enhances immunity

Patients may benefit from one or both mechanisms.
