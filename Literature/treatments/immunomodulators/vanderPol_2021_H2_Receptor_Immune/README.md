# van der Pol 2021: H2 Receptor Blockade and Immune Cells

## Citation
van der Pol E, et al. Histamine receptor 2 blockade selectively impacts B and T cells in healthy subjects. *Sci Rep*. 2021;11:9105. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-88829-w.

## Quick Summary
**Type:** Clinical study (healthy volunteers)
**Finding:** Ranitidine (H2 antagonist) decreases B cells and activated T cells; reduces IL-2, IL-15, IL-1β
**Mechanism:** H2 receptor blockade on immune cells
**Certainty:** MEDIUM (controlled study, but healthy volunteers not ME/CFS patients)

## Key Findings
**Cellular Effects:**
- Decreased B cells (measured in peripheral blood)
- Decreased IL-2Rα (CD25) expressing T cells
- Decreased NK cell activation markers (NKG2D)

**Cytokine Effects:**
- Decreased IL-2 (T cell growth factor)
- Decreased IL-15 (NK/T cell homeostasis)
- Decreased IL-1β (inflammation)

**Interpretation:** H2 receptor blockade has immunosuppressive effects on adaptive immunity

## Relevance to ME/CFS
- Provides modern validation of H2 receptor immune effects
- Paradox: Shows immunosuppressive effects, but Goldstein proposed immune enhancement
- Resolution: Context-dependent (reducing excessive activation vs. enhancing suppressed function)
- Supports differential effects on immune subsets

## Role in Literature Set
**Supporting paper** for immune mechanism. Provides modern immunological validation of H2 receptor effects. Primary immune mechanism paper is Simons 2019 (comprehensive review). This adds specific controlled study data in humans.

## Important Context
Study was in **healthy volunteers**, not ME/CFS patients. Effects may differ in disease state with pre-existing immune dysfunction. The immunosuppressive effects shown here seem contrary to Goldstein's therapeutic hypothesis, but may reflect:
1. **Different populations:** Healthy vs. diseased immune systems
2. **Different outcomes measured:** Baseline activation vs. response capacity
3. **Context-dependent effects:** H2 blockade may normalize dysregulated immunity

## Notes
Well-controlled modern study validating H2 receptor effects on human immune cells. Demonstrates that H2 antagonists do affect immunity, supporting biological plausibility of therapeutic effects, even if specific effects differ from Goldstein's original hypothesis. The complexity of immune effects underscores need for controlled ME/CFS trials rather than mechanistic extrapolation.
