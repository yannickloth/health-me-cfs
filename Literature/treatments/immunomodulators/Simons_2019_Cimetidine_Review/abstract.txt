ABSTRACT:

Cimetidine, an H2-receptor antagonist used primarily for acid suppression, exerts powerful immunomodulatory effects on both innate and adaptive immune systems. This review comprehensively examines cimetidine's immunological properties and therapeutic potential for immune-related diseases.

Cimetidine reduces regulatory/suppressor T cell-mediated immunosuppression while having powerful stimulatory effects on CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. It diminishes suppressor T cell effects in both cellular- and antibody-mediated immune reactions. The immunomodulatory effects occur through multiple mechanisms including effects on histamine receptors on immune cells, suppressor cell function, and cytokine production.

Therapeutic applications investigated include viral warts, viral infections (including herpesvirus), vaccine adjuvant properties, and various immune-mediated conditions. Cimetidine enhances both antibody- and cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune responses.

The review analyzes preclinical and clinical evidence for cimetidine's immunomodulatory properties, discusses mechanisms of action, evaluates therapeutic applications across immune-related diseases, and identifies gaps requiring further investigation. While promising immunological effects are well-documented, many potential therapeutic applications require rigorous controlled clinical trials for validation.
