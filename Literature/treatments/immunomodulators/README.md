# Immunomodulators for ME/CFS

This folder contains literature on immunomodulatory interventions for ME/CFS, focusing on agents that modulate immune function rather than directly targeting pathogens.

## Contents

### Cimetidine and H2 Receptor Antagonists

**Overview:** H2 receptor antagonists (primarily cimetidine) have limited but intriguing evidence for ME/CFS benefit, particularly in patients with viral reactivation. Evidence reveals **two distinct mechanisms**:

1. **Immune modulation** (Goldstein 1986): H2 blockade reduces suppressor T cell function
2. **Pharmacokinetic enhancement** (Stuijt 2026): Increases antiviral drug concentrations

**Papers:**
- `Goldstein_1986_Cimetidine_EBV/` - Historical clinical observations (immune mechanism)
- `Stuijt_2026_Cimetidine_Acyclovir/` - Recent pharmacokinetic evidence
- `Simons_2019_Cimetidine_Review/` - Comprehensive immunomodulation review
- `Soul-Lawton_2001_Cimetidine_Valacyclovir/` - Pharmacokinetic interaction quantification
- `vanderPol_2021_H2_Receptor_Immune/` - Modern validation of H2 immune effects

**Summary Files:**
- `CIMETIDINE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete integration guidance for chapters
- `APPENDIX_H_ENTRIES.tex` - Annotated bibliography entries (ready to insert)

**Evidence Quality:** VERY LOW for ME/CFS efficacy (case series, no RCTs)
**Certainty:** MEDIUM for mechanisms; VERY LOW for clinical efficacy

**Clinical Context:**
- Only ~1-2% of patients respond dramatically
- Responders likely have viral reactivation as primary driver
- Two mechanisms may work independently or synergistically
- Drug interaction concerns (CYP450 inhibition)
- Famotidine may be safer alternative for chronic use

**Research Status:**
- ✅ 5 papers documented
- ✅ BibTeX entries added to references.bib
- ✅ Appendix H entries drafted
- ✅ Integration guide created for chapter-integrator
- ⏳ Main chapter integration pending

**Integration Targets:**
1. Antiviral treatment chapter (Stuijt pharmacokinetics - PRIMARY)
2. Immune dysfunction chapter (Goldstein/Simons immunomodulation)
3. Viral reactivation chapter (combined mechanisms hypothesis)
4. Treatment landscape (experimental/evidence limitations)

## Other Immunomodulators

*(Space for future additions)*

Potential future topics:
- Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) - already covered in main appendix
- Rituximab (negative evidence) - already covered
- Other immune-modulating agents as evidence emerges

## General Notes

**Immunomodulation Rationale:**
ME/CFS involves immune dysfunction including:
- T cell abnormalities
- NK cell dysfunction
- Cytokine dysregulation
- Possible autoimmunity in subsets

Immunomodulatory approaches aim to correct these abnormalities, but evidence quality is generally low with high placebo response rates (rituximab: 35% placebo response).

**Key Lesson from Rituximab:**
Early promising results (open-label) completely failed in Phase III RCT. This emphasizes:
- Need for placebo-controlled validation
- High placebo response in ME/CFS trials
- Cannot extrapolate from mechanistic studies to clinical efficacy

**Cimetidine Context:**
Following rituximab lesson, cimetidine's anecdotal benefits and mechanistic plausibility do NOT constitute evidence of efficacy. Controlled trials needed before recommendations.
