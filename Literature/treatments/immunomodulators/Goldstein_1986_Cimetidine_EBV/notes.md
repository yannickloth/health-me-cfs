**Author:** Jay A. Goldstein, MD
**Journal:** Annals of Internal Medicine, July 1986, Volume 105, Issue 1, page 139
**DOI:** 10.7326/0003-4819-105-1-139_2
**PMID:** 3013060
**Publication Type:** Letter to the editor

## Key Points
- First clinical report of H2 receptor antagonists for EBV-related chronic fatigue
- Proposed mechanism: H2 blockade reduces suppressor T cell function
- Enhanced cell-mediated immunity enables viral clearance
- Initially tested on acute mononucleosis patients with reported success
- Extended treatment approach to chronic fatigue syndrome patients
- Reported "positive results in 90% of cases of mononucleosis treated with Tagamet"

## Methodology
**Study Design:** Clinical case series/observational letter
**Population:** Patients with acute infectious mononucleosis and chronic EBV infection (CFS)
**Intervention:** Cimetidine (Tagamet) or ranitidine (Zantac)
**Dosing:** Later sources indicate 200mg four times daily (not specified in original letter)
**Duration:** Variable; one case report mentions 10 months
**Outcome:** Reported rapid symptom resolution in acute mono; improvement in CFS patients

## Theoretical Mechanism
1. **H2 receptors on T suppressor cells:** Histamine activates suppressor T cells via H2 receptors
2. **H2 blockade:** Cimetidine/ranitidine block histamine activation of suppressor cells
3. **Enhanced immunity:** Reduced suppressor function allows increased cell-mediated immunity
4. **Viral clearance:** Enhanced cytotoxic T cell function improves control of EBV reactivation

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** Very Low (letter/case series, no controlled design)
- **Sample Size:** Not specified in original letter; anecdotal reports
- **Replication:** Limited; concept explored in broader immunomodulation literature but not specifically for ME/CFS
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Not disclosed (1986 publication)
- **Limitations:**
  - No controlled trial
  - No objective outcome measures
  - Patient selection criteria unclear
  - No blinding
  - Limited follow-up data
  - Published only as brief letter

## Historical Context
- Published during peak interest in "chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome" (later renamed CFS/ME)
- Part of early wave of immune-modulating approaches for CFS
- Influenced subsequent clinical experimentation with H2 antagonists
- Represents hypothesis-driven clinical innovation typical of 1980s CFS treatment exploration

## Clinical Relevance
- Establishes historical precedent for H2 antagonist use in CFS
- Provides mechanistic rationale for immunomodulation via suppressor T cell blockade
- Suggests potential responder subgroup (EBV-driven cases)
- Notable limitation: tolerance development reported with long-term use
