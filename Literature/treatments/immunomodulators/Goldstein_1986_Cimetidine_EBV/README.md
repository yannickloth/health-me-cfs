# Goldstein 1986: Cimetidine, Ranitidine, and Epstein-Barr Virus Infection

## Citation
Goldstein JA. Cimetidine, ranitidine, and Epstein-Barr virus infection. *Ann Intern Med*. 1986 Jul;105(1):139. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-105-1-139_2. PMID: 3013060.

## Quick Summary
**Type:** Letter to editor (case series)
**Finding:** H2 antagonists may benefit ME/CFS patients with EBV reactivation
**Mechanism:** H2 blockade reduces suppressor T cells → enhanced cell-mediated immunity
**Certainty:** VERY LOW (anecdotal, no controls)

- `notes.md` - Comprehensive analysis
- `key-findings.md` - Clinical implications and integration points
- `README.md` - This file

## Key Points
- First clinical report of H2 antagonists for EBV-related CFS (1986)
- Reported "90% response" in acute mononucleosis
- Proposed immune modulation mechanism (suppressor T cell blockade)
- Evidence quality very low (letter, no controls)
- Historical significance but requires modern validation

## Relevance to ME/CFS
- Establishes precedent for H2 antagonist experimentation
- Suggests responder phenotype (~1-2% dramatic response)
- Viral reactivation as primary driver in responders
- Tolerance may develop with long-term use
