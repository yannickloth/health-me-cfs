ABSTRACT: [Letter to the editor - no abstract available]

This brief communication reports Dr. Goldstein's clinical observations using H2 receptor antagonists (cimetidine/ranitidine) for treating Epstein-Barr virus infections, including chronic fatigue syndrome. The letter describes the rationale based on H2 receptor blockade reducing suppressor T cell function, thereby enhancing cell-mediated immunity against viral infections.
