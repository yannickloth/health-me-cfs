# Ketamine for ME/CFS: Literature Review

**Status:** Active investigation - no dedicated ME/CFS clinical trials identified as of January 2026

**Classification:** NMDA receptor antagonist; anesthetic; investigational treatment for chronic pain and neuroinflammatory conditions

## Overview

Ketamine is being explored as a potential treatment for ME/CFS based on its mechanisms of action that may address several pathophysiological features of the disease:

1. **NMDA receptor antagonism** - may reduce central sensitization and neuronal hyperexcitability
2. **Anti-neuroinflammatory effects** - reduces microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α)
3. **Neuroprotective properties** - reduces excitotoxicity and may enhance synaptic plasticity
4. **Anti-fatigue effects** - demonstrated in depression and bipolar disorder studies

## Clinical Trial Status

**ME/CFS-specific trials:** NONE identified (as of January 2026)

**Related conditions:**
- Fibromyalgia: Multiple case reports, systematic reviews, ongoing ESKEFIB trial (S-ketamine)
- MS fatigue: NCT03500289
- Depression-related fatigue: Multiple completed trials showing anti-fatigue effects

**Note:** German resources mentioned "Ketamin laufen Studien" (ketamine trials are running), but no registered ME/CFS trials found on ClinicalTrials.gov.

## Evidence Quality

**For ME/CFS:** Low - anecdotal reports, clinic-based observations, mechanistic rationale
**For fibromyalgia:** Medium - systematic reviews, case series, small RCTs
**For mechanisms:** Medium-High - well-characterized NMDA antagonism and anti-inflammatory effects in multiple conditions

### Anti-fatigue Effects

7. **Intranasal ketamine for fatigue** - 2024 study showing anti-fatigue effects in severe MDD/bipolar depression

## Mechanistic Rationale for ME/CFS

### NMDA Receptor Dysregulation in ME/CFS
- ATP depletion in ME/CFS associated with NMDA stimulation and hypersensitivity
- Low neuronal energy markedly increases sensitivity to glutamate excitotoxicity
- Elevated glutamate and low GABA observed in ME/CFS (disrupts metabolic shuttles)
- Central sensitization involving NMDA receptors may contribute to PEM

### Neuroinflammation
- ME/CFS involves microglial activation and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Ketamine reduces IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α release from microglia
- May interrupt peripheral-central neurogenic sensitization loops

### Central Sensitization
- Generalized hyperalgesia in ME/CFS augmented by stressors (exercise, heat)
- NMDA receptor antagonists proposed as treatment for central sensitization
- May address symptom amplification following exertion

## Safety Considerations

### Abuse Potential
- Significant misuse risk at recreational doses
- Recreational doses 15-20% lower than anesthetic doses
- Medical protocols use sub-dissociative doses (0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV)

### Contraindications
- Active psychotic symptoms
- Unstable cardiovascular disease
- Current substance use disorders
- Significant vascular aneurysms
- Inability to comprehend risks

### Adverse Effects (Chronic Use)
- Cognitive impairment and memory deficits
- Urological toxicity (increasing concern with long-term misuse)
- Psychological and physical dependence
- Dissociative symptoms, dysphoria

### Required Monitoring
- Continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring during administration
- Blood pressure and heart rate surveillance
- Mental status assessment (CADSS/KSET scales)
- Post-administration observation (minimum 30 minutes)

## Clinical Context

### Fibromyalgia Experience
- ~50% pain reduction in some patient series (Dr. Podell)
- Low-dose infusions: effects last only hours
- High-dose protocols: sustained effects with maintenance dosing
- Case reports show doses from 200-1,063 mg over multiple sessions
- Maintenance protocols: typically twice monthly

### Practical Considerations
- Requires specialized clinic setting
- Administration by trained providers (anesthesiologists, pain specialists, psychiatrists)
- Not suitable for home use
- Expensive - typically not covered by insurance for ME/CFS
- Long-term efficacy unknown

## Integration Status

**Literature files created:** 2026-01-29
**References.bib entries:** Pending
**Appendix H entries:** Pending
**Chapter integration guides:** Created

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for emergence of ME/CFS-specific clinical trials
2. Track ESKEFIB trial results (fibromyalgia) for transferable insights
3. Evaluate case reports from ME/CFS patients receiving ketamine
4. Consider whether mechanistic overlap warrants inclusion in treatment chapter
5. Track safety data from chronic use in pain conditions

## Certainty Assessment

**Efficacy for ME/CFS:** VERY LOW (no trials, anecdotal only)
**Mechanistic relevance:** MEDIUM (plausible based on pathophysiology)
**Safety profile:** MEDIUM (well-characterized in other conditions, requires strict protocols)
**Clinical feasibility:** LOW (specialized setting, cost, regulatory barriers)
