# Ketamine Mechanisms of Action Relevant to ME/CFS

**Primary source:** Koutsaliaris & Tsoulos (2025), "Ketamine's Role in Neuroinflammation and Neuroprotection"
**Additional sources:** Multiple systematic reviews and mechanistic studies

## 1. NMDA Receptor Antagonism

### Basic Mechanism
- Ketamine functions as a **use-dependent blocker** of NMDA receptors
- Binds inside the channel at an allosteric site only accessible when channel is open
- Reduces calcium and sodium influx → decreases neuronal excitability
- Non-competitive antagonist (different from competitive antagonists like memantine)

### Relevance to ME/CFS
**ATP depletion → NMDA hypersensitivity:**
- ATP depletion observed in ME/CFS is associated with NMDA stimulation and hypersensitivity
- Low neuronal energy production markedly increases sensitivity to glutamate excitotoxicity
- NMDA receptor activation results in increased levels of ONOO⁻ (peroxynitrite)
- Triggers loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis

**Glutamate dysregulation in ME/CFS:**
- Reproducible triad: low aspartate, elevated glutamate, low GABA
- Disrupts malate-aspartate shuttle
- Promotes glutamate excitotoxicity
- Impairs autonomic inhibitory tone
- Glutamate accumulation overstimulates NMDA receptors → activates microglia → drives neuroinflammation

**Central sensitization:**
- When sensory-afferent signals overwhelm filtering capacity → NMDA dysregulation
- Various studies show generalized hyperalgesia in ME/CFS to multiple stimuli
- Hyperalgesia augmented (not decreased) by stressors like exercise and heat
- NMDA receptor antagonists proposed as treatment for central sensitization

## 2. Anti-Neuroinflammatory Effects

### Microglial Modulation
- **Suppresses microglial activation** and pro-inflammatory signaling
- Reduces release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglial cells:
  - IL-8
  - TNF-α
  - IL-6

### Cytokine Effects (Evidence from Multiple Studies)

**Depression + comorbid pain studies:**
- Patients showed reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels alongside clinical improvement
- Anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to therapeutic effects

**Preclinical evidence (bipolar model):**
- 10 mg/kg dose: decreased stress-induced elevations of IL-6 and IL-1β in hippocampus and PFC
- 20 mg/kg dose: reversed depressive phenotype AND serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1β

**Viral sepsis context:**
- Downregulates inflammatory cytokines including IL-6

### Relevance to ME/CFS
- ME/CFS involves microglial activation and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Neuroinflammation contributes to fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, pain amplification
- Ketamine's anti-inflammatory effects specifically target IL-6 (repeatedly elevated in ME/CFS)
- May interrupt peripheral-central neurogenic sensitization loops

## 3. Neuroprotective Mechanisms

### Reduction of Excitotoxicity
Ketamine reduces excitotoxicity through multiple pathways:
- Decreases extrasynaptic stimulation of neurotoxic NMDARs
- Reduces presynaptic glutamate release
- Limits calcium-mediated cell death processes

### Synaptic Plasticity Enhancement
- May enhance dendritic spine density regulation
- Potentially leads to emergence of new neuronal synapses
- Contrasts with damage from chronic NMDA overactivation

### Mitochondrial Protection
- Indirect protection by reducing excitotoxic stress
- May preserve mitochondrial membrane potential
- Reduces peroxynitrite formation (ONOO⁻)

### Relevance to ME/CFS
- Low ATP in ME/CFS creates vulnerability to excitotoxic injury
- Mitochondrial dysfunction central to ME/CFS pathophysiology
- Neuroprotection may prevent progressive neurological deterioration
- Could address cognitive dysfunction and brain fog

## 4. Beyond NMDA: Additional Mechanisms

### Glutamatergic Signaling Modulation
- Reduces GABAergic inhibition
- Increases glutamate release (paradoxical but transient)
- Net effect: modulates glutaminergic signaling comprehensively
- May help rebalance excitatory/inhibitory dynamics

### Neurotransmitter Systems
- Affects serotonin and norepinephrine production
- May modulate dopaminergic pathways
- Interacts with opioid systems

### mTOR Pathway Activation
- Rapid antidepressant effects involve mTOR pathway
- Promotes synaptic protein synthesis
- May enhance neuroplasticity

---

## 5. Anti-Fatigue Effects (Beyond Mood)

### Evidence from Depression Studies

**Bipolar disorder crossover study (McIntyre et al.):**
- 36 participants with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder
- Single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes)
- Ketamine significantly improved fatigue over placebo within 40 minutes
- Greatest efficacy at day 2
- **Anti-fatigue effect not fully accounted for by anti-depressant effect**
- Suggests direct anti-fatigue mechanism independent of mood improvement

**Intranasal ketamine study (2024):**
- Severe MDD and bipolar depression with/without alcohol use disorder
- Single 50 mg dose intranasal ketamine
- Induced rapid anti-fatigue effects
- Benefits independent of comorbid AUD status

### Potential Mechanisms for Anti-Fatigue Effects
1. Reduced neuroinflammation (IL-6 reduction specifically linked to fatigue)
2. Improved neurotransmitter dynamics
3. Enhanced neuroplasticity and neural efficiency
4. Reduced central sensitization contributing to fatigue amplification
5. Mitochondrial/metabolic improvements (indirect)

### Relevance to ME/CFS
- Fatigue in ME/CFS responds poorly to standard monoaminergic antidepressants
- Ketamine shows anti-fatigue effects even when mood unchanged
- Could reduce "daily physical and social interferences of fatigue"
- May address central (brain-based) contribution to fatigue

---

## 6. Mechanisms Particularly Relevant to PEM

### Potential PEM-Relevant Pathways

**Pre-exertion:**
- Reduces baseline neuroinflammation and microglial priming
- May increase metabolic reserve/resilience
- Dampens central sensitization that amplifies post-exertion symptoms

**During exertion:**
- NMDA antagonism may limit excitotoxic injury from metabolic stress
- Anti-inflammatory effects may reduce cytokine surge
- Neuroprotection during periods of ATP depletion

**Post-exertion:**
- May interrupt positive feedback loops (sensitization → inflammation → more sensitization)
- Could reduce delayed cytokine responses
- Might accelerate return to baseline

**Limitations:**
- No direct evidence for PEM effects
- Most studies use acute dosing, PEM is a delayed phenomenon
- Unclear if neuroprotection extends to peripheral metabolic dysfunction

## 7. Dose-Dependent Effects

### Clinical Dosing Ranges

**Sub-dissociative analgesia:**
- 0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV
- Used for pain management
- Minimal psychoactive effects

**Antidepressant dosing:**
- 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes (standard research protocol)
- 50 mg intranasal
- Psychoactive effects expected but controlled

**Fibromyalgia protocols (from case reports):**
- Initial: 200-240 mg (escalating)
- Maintenance: up to 1,063 mg in intensive protocols
- Higher doses, longer duration, more frequent

### Time Course
- NMDA blockade: immediate during infusion
- Anti-inflammatory effects: hours to days
- Neuroplasticity changes: days to weeks
- Anti-fatigue effects: 40 minutes to 2 days peak

## 8. Limitations and Unknowns for ME/CFS Application

### What We Don't Know
1. **Optimal dosing for ME/CFS**: fibromyalgia protocols may not transfer
2. **Frequency of administration**: unclear if benefits require maintenance dosing
3. **Effect on PEM specifically**: no data
4. **Effect on orthostatic intolerance**: no data
5. **Effect on immune dysfunction**: limited to CNS effects
6. **Peripheral vs central effects**: ketamine primarily CNS-active
7. **Long-term outcomes**: chronic use data limited to abuse contexts
8. **Interaction with existing ME/CFS pathophysiology**: speculative

### Mechanistic Gaps
- ME/CFS involves peripheral metabolic dysfunction (ketamine primarily CNS)
- Autoimmune components may not respond to NMDA antagonism
- Mitochondrial dysfunction may be upstream of neuroinflammation
- PEM involves systemic post-exertional metabolic crisis
- Ketamine may address consequences but not root causes

---

## 9. Comparison with Other NMDA Antagonists

### Why Ketamine vs Memantine?
- **Memantine**: competitive antagonist, much lower affinity, minimal psychoactive effects
- **Ketamine**: non-competitive, use-dependent, psychoactive
- Ketamine has additional mechanisms beyond NMDA (anti-inflammatory, neuroplasticity)
- Memantine has been tested in ME/CFS with limited success

### Other NMDA Antagonists
- Dextromethorphan (DXM): similar but weaker effects, OTC availability, abuse potential
- Magnesium: weak NMDA antagonist, safer but less potent
- Nitrous oxide: rapid-acting, similar antidepressant effects, impractical for chronic use

## 10. Integration with ME/CFS Pathophysiology Models

### Neurometabolic Model
- **ATP depletion → NMDA hypersensitivity**: ketamine may break this cycle
- **Glutamate accumulation**: ketamine may reduce excitotoxic consequences
- **Central sensitization → PEM amplification**: ketamine may dampen sensitization

### Neuroinflammatory Model
- **Microglial activation → cytokine release**: ketamine directly addresses this
- **IL-6 elevation**: ketamine specifically reduces IL-6
- **Peripheral-central sensitization loops**: ketamine may interrupt

### Metabolic/Mitochondrial Model
- **Limited direct effect**: ketamine doesn't fix mitochondrial dysfunction
- **Indirect benefit**: reduces secondary excitotoxic injury during ATP depletion
- **May address CNS manifestations** without fixing peripheral energy crisis

### Combined Model
- Ketamine may address CNS/neuroinflammatory component
- Unlikely to address peripheral immune/metabolic dysfunction
- Best viewed as symptomatic/neuroprotective rather than curative

## Summary: Mechanistic Plausibility for ME/CFS

### STRONG Mechanistic Rationale
1. NMDA antagonism → reduces central sensitization
2. Anti-neuroinflammatory effects → reduces cytokines implicated in ME/CFS
3. Neuroprotection during metabolic stress → relevant to ATP depletion
4. Anti-fatigue effects independent of mood → addresses core symptom

### MEDIUM Mechanistic Rationale
5. Microglial modulation → may reduce neuroinflammation
6. Glutamate/GABA rebalancing → addresses observed dysregulation
7. Enhanced neuroplasticity → may counter cognitive dysfunction

### WEAK/SPECULATIVE Mechanistic Rationale
8. Effect on PEM → no direct evidence
9. Effect on peripheral symptoms → ketamine is CNS-focused
10. Long-term disease modification → likely symptomatic only

### CERTAINTY: Medium mechanistic plausibility, VERY LOW clinical evidence
