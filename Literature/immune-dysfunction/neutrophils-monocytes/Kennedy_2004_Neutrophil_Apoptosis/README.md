## Abstract

This study investigated whether CFS patients exhibit increased neutrophil apoptosis similar to what occurs during active infection. Researchers measured apoptosis markers and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) in 47 CFS patients compared to 34 age and sex-matched healthy controls.

## Key Findings

**Increased Neutrophil Apoptosis:**
- Higher numbers of apoptotic neutrophils in CFS
- Lower numbers of viable neutrophils
- Increased annexin V binding (37.4% vs 22.8%; p=0.001)
- Greater expression of TNFRI death receptor (p=0.004)

**Elevated TGFβ1:**
- Raised active TGFβ1 concentrations (p<0.005)
- May contribute to apoptosis induction

**Clinical Implication:**
The authors concluded that CFS patients have "an underlying, detectable abnormality in the behaviour of their immune cells, consistent with an activated inflammatory process."

## Significance

This study demonstrates that immune activation in CFS extends beyond lymphocytes to innate immune cells (neutrophils), suggesting a **systemic inflammatory state** with accelerated neutrophil turnover.
