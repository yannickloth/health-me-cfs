# Key Findings: Brenu et al. 2011

## Primary Strength

**Large comprehensive immune profiling study (n=95)**

This is one of the largest systematic immune assessments in ME/CFS, examining:
- NK and CD8+ T cell function
- Cytokine profiles (Th1/Th2)
- Regulatory T cells
- Receptor expression patterns

## Key Immune Abnormalities

### Cytotoxic Dysfunction
- Reduced NK cell cytotoxicity (confirms other studies)
- **Reduced CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity** (supports Maher 2005 findings)
- Decreased CD56bright NK populations
- Paradox: **Low granzyme A/K despite elevated perforin**

### Cytokine Dysregulation
| Cytokine | Direction | Function |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| IL-10 | ↑ Elevated | Anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive |
| IFN-γ | ↑ Elevated | Pro-inflammatory, antiviral |
| TNF-α | ↑ Elevated | Pro-inflammatory |

This mixed profile suggests **simultaneous activation and suppression** of immune responses.

### Regulatory Cell Expansion
- Increased CD4+CD25+ T cells (Tregs)
- Increased FoxP3 expression (Treg marker)
- May contribute to immunosuppression

## Integration Points for Chapter 7

1. **NK cell section** (lines ~151-180): Cite for large-sample confirmation of NK dysfunction
2. **T cell section** (lines ~526-600): CD8+ cytotoxicity deficit
3. **Cytokine section** (lines ~601-710): IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α elevation
4. **Granzyme/perforin** discussion: Paradox of elevated perforin but low granzymes
5. **Biomarker discussion**: Authors propose these as potential diagnostic markers

## Evidence Level

**HIGH CERTAINTY**
- Large sample size (n=95 patients, n=50 controls)
- Comprehensive multi-parameter assessment
- Published in high-quality translational journal
- Confirms and extends findings from multiple smaller studies
