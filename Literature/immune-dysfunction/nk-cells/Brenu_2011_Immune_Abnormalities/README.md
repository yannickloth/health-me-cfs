## Abstract

This comprehensive study assessed multiple immune parameters in 95 CFS/ME patients compared to 50 controls, including natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activities, Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles, regulatory T cells, and receptor expression patterns.

## Key Findings

**Cytotoxic Cell Deficits:**
- Significantly reduced NK cell cytotoxicity
- Decreased CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity
- Reduced CD56bright NK cell populations
- Decreased granzyme A and K expression despite elevated perforin levels

**Cytokine Elevation:**
- Elevated IL-10 (anti-inflammatory)
- Elevated IFN-γ (pro-inflammatory)
- Elevated TNF-α (pro-inflammatory)

**Regulatory Cell Changes:**
- Increased CD4+CD25+ T cells
- Increased FoxP3 expression
- Heightened VPACR2 expression

## Significance

This is one of the **largest comprehensive immune profiling studies** in ME/CFS (n=95), providing evidence for multiple coordinated immune abnormalities that may serve as diagnostic biomarkers.
