# Key Findings: Eaton-Fitch et al. 2019

## Primary Finding

**Impaired NK cell cytotoxicity is the most consistent immunological abnormality in ME/CFS**

Of 17 case-control studies reviewed:
- 11 studies investigated NK cell cytotoxicity
- 7/11 (64%) reported significantly reduced killing capacity in ME/CFS vs controls
- This represents the most replicated finding across all immune parameters examined

## Significance for Chapter 7

This systematic review provides:
1. **High-certainty evidence** for NK dysfunction (multiple independent replications)
2. **Quantitative support** for NK cytotoxicity as a core deficit
3. **Historical perspective** showing consistency from 1994-2018
4. **Methodological assessment** of measurement approaches

## Integration Points

- NK cell cytotoxicity section (lines ~151-180)
- Should be cited as primary evidence for the consistency of NK dysfunction
- Supports claims about NK cells as a "reliable cellular model"
- Justifies focus on NK cells as central to immune dysfunction in ME/CFS

## Evidence Level

**HIGH CERTAINTY**
- Systematic review of 17 studies
- Consistent findings across multiple independent groups
- Published in high-quality methodology journal
- Covers 24-year period (1994-2018)
