## Abstract

This systematic review examined natural killer (NK) cell function in ME/CFS patients. Researchers systematically searched Medline (EBSCOHost), Scopus, EMBASE and PubMed databases to source relevant papers published between 1994 and March 2018. Of 17 studies meeting inclusion criteria, 11 investigated NK cell cytotoxicity, with 7 reporting significantly reduced killing capacity in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls.

## Key Findings

**Most Consistent Finding:** Impaired NK cell cytotoxicity remained the most consistent immunological report across all publications.

**Conclusion:** The authors concluded that impaired NK cell cytotoxicity is "a reliable and appropriate cellular model for continued research in ME/CFS patients."

**Evidence Quality:** This systematic review provides high-certainty evidence for NK cell dysfunction as a core immunological feature of ME/CFS.
