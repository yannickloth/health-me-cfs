# Key Findings: Maher et al. 2005

## Primary Finding

**CFS patients have 45% reduction in NK cell perforin content**

This provides a mechanistic explanation for impaired NK cytotoxicity:
- NK cells cannot effectively kill target cells without sufficient perforin
- Deficiency is quantifiable and consistent across CFS patients
- Represents a specific molecular deficit (not just general "dysfunction")

## Quantitative Data

| Parameter | CFS | Controls | Reduction | p-value |
|-----------|-----|----------|-----------|---------|
| NK perforin (rMol/cell) | 3,320 | 6,051 | 45% | 0.01 |

## Novel Discovery

**First evidence of cytotoxic T cell deficit:**
- CD8+ T cells also showed reduced perforin (trend toward significance)
- Suggests cytotoxic dysfunction extends beyond NK cells
- May explain broader immune surveillance impairment

## Integration Points for Chapter 7

- NK cell cytotoxicity mechanism section (lines ~151-180)
- Should explain WHY NK cells are dysfunctional (not just that they are)
- Cite when discussing perforin, granzymes, or cytotoxic mechanisms
- Links NK dysfunction to potential viral reactivation (inadequate immune surveillance)

## Evidence Level

**HIGH CERTAINTY**
- Clear quantitative finding with statistical significance
- Published in high-impact immunology journal
- Provides mechanistic insight beyond phenomenological observation
- Direct measurement of molecular marker
