## Abstract

Researchers investigated the molecular basis of diminished natural killer cell cytotoxicity in CFS by measuring intracellular perforin levels. Perforin is a key cytotoxic protein found in NK and CD8+ T cell granules that mediates target cell lysis.

## Key Findings

**NK Cell Perforin Deficiency:**
- CFS patients: 3,320 rMol perforin/NK cell
- Healthy controls: 6,051 rMol perforin/NK cell
- **45% reduction** (p = 0.01)

**CD8+ T Cell Findings:**
- Reduced perforin in cytotoxic T cells (approached significance)
- **First evidence** of T cell-associated cytotoxic deficit in CFS

**Functional Correlation:**
- Significant correlation between NK cell activity and intracellular perforin levels across all participants
- Suggests perforin deficiency directly contributes to impaired cytotoxicity

## Significance

This study provides a **mechanistic explanation** for the consistently observed NK cell dysfunction in CFS: insufficient perforin prevents effective target cell killing even when NK cells are activated.
