## Abstract

This study investigated immune cell metabolism in ME/CFS by isolating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and analyzing glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in both resting and activated states. Researchers measured cellular metabolism markers and plasma cytokines to identify dysfunction patterns.

## Key Findings

**CD8+ T Cell Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**
- Reduced mitochondrial membrane potential compared to controls
- Impaired oxidative phosphorylation

**Glycolytic Defects:**
- Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed reduced glycolysis at rest
- CD8+ T cells maintained reduced glycolysis even after activation
- Suggests impaired metabolic reprogramming

**Cytokine-Metabolism Correlations:**
- ME/CFS patients exhibited unique relationships between plasma cytokines and T cell metabolism
- These correlations differed significantly from those in healthy controls
- Indicates dysregulated immune-metabolic coupling

**Clinical Significance:**
The authors concluded that patients have "impaired T cell metabolism consistent with ongoing immune alterations" that may contribute to the immune dysfunction characteristic of ME/CFS.

## Significance

This is the **first comprehensive metabolic analysis of T cells** in ME/CFS, demonstrating that immune dysfunction extends to fundamental cellular bioenergetics, linking immune and energy metabolism chapters.
