# Key Findings: Mandarano et al. 2020

## Primary Innovation

**First comprehensive T cell metabolic analysis in ME/CFS**

This study bridges immune dysfunction and bioenergetic impairment:
- Directly measures mitochondrial function in immune cells
- Connects Chapter 6 (Energy Metabolism) to Chapter 7 (Immune Dysfunction)
- Demonstrates that metabolic deficits are not limited to muscle/nervous system

## Quantitative Metabolic Deficits

### CD8+ T Cells (Most Affected)
- **Reduced mitochondrial membrane potential** (marker of dysfunction)
- **Reduced glycolysis at rest** (impaired baseline metabolism)
- **Reduced glycolysis after activation** (impaired metabolic response)

### CD4+ T Cells
- **Reduced glycolysis at rest** (baseline impairment)
- Normal activation response (less severely affected than CD8+)

## Mechanistic Implications

**Why this matters for immune function:**

1. **T cell activation requires metabolic reprogramming:**
   - Resting T cells use oxidative phosphorylation
   - Activated T cells switch to glycolysis (Warburg effect)
   - ME/CFS T cells cannot make this switch effectively

2. **Impaired activation = impaired antiviral/immune response:**
   - Reduced proliferation capacity
   - Reduced cytokine production
   - Reduced cytotoxic function

3. **Links to other findings:**
   - May explain reduced CD8+ cytotoxicity (Brenu 2011, Maher 2005)
   - Connects immune to mitochondrial dysfunction (Paul 2019)
   - Supports bioenergetic crisis hypothesis

## Cytokine-Metabolism Dysregulation

**Unique correlation patterns in ME/CFS:**
- Healthy controls: predictable cytokine-metabolism relationships
- ME/CFS: altered correlations suggest dysregulated signaling
- Indicates systemic immune-metabolic uncoupling

## Integration Points for Chapter 7

1. **T cell section** (lines ~526-600): Cite for T cell metabolic dysfunction
2. **Cross-reference to Chapter 6:** "As discussed in Ch6, mitochondrial dysfunction affects immune cells"
3. **CD8+ cytotoxicity:** Metabolic deficits may underlie functional impairment
4. **Energy-immune link:** Use to explain why immune activation worsens fatigue (PEM)

## Integration Points for Chapter 6

- Immune cells show same mitochondrial deficits as muscle/neurons
- Immune activation is energetically costly
- May contribute to bioenergetic crisis during infections

## Evidence Level

**HIGH CERTAINTY**
- Large sample (n=53 patients, n=45 controls)
- Published in top-tier journal (JCI - Journal of Clinical Investigation)
- Direct metabolic measurements (not just phenomenological)
- Multiple parameters assessed (glycolysis, OXPHOS, membrane potential)
- Provides mechanistic explanation for functional deficits
