**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jpain.2009.06.003
**PMID:** 19647494

## Key Points
- Post-moderate-exercise, CFS patients showed significantly greater increases than controls in:
  - Metabolite-detecting receptors: ASIC3, P2X4, P2X5
  - Immune markers: IL-10 and TLR4 gene expression
- TLR4 elevation specifically notable: TLR4 is a pattern recognition receptor on immune cells (including microglia) that activates NF-kB and cytokine production
- Gene expression changes persisted for 48 hours post-exercise (vs. rapid normalization in controls)
- These gene expression patterns correlated with fatigue and pain severity

## Methodology
- Case-control study
- Moderate treadmill exercise challenge
- qPCR of leukocyte gene expression at multiple timepoints (before, during, 8h, 24h, 48h post)
- n=19 CFS patients, n=18 controls

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** High (controlled exercise challenge, qPCR validation, multiple timepoints)
- **Sample Size:** n=37 total (small-medium)
- **Replication:** Replicated in follow-up Light et al. 2012 studies
- **Conflicts of Interest:** University of Utah group; no commercial bias
- **Overall:** Medium-High certainty

## Relevance to Ch15 Sec 15.4
- Directly addresses TLR4 upregulation after exercise in CFS (links to TLR4/NF-kB microglial TODO)
- TLR4 on peripheral immune cells acts as a sensor that, when elevated, drives NF-kB and cytokine production
- Provides mechanistic link between PEM and cytokine-mediated symptom amplification
- IL-10 elevation may reflect regulatory response to pro-inflammatory cytokine surge
