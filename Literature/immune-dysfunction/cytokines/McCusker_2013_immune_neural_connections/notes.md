# Immune-neural connections: how the immune system's response to infectious agents influences behavior

**Authors:** McCusker RH, Kelley KW
**Journal:** Journal of Experimental Biology, 2013, 216(Pt 1):84-98
**DOI:** 10.1242/jeb.073411
**PMID:** 23225871

## Key Points
- Dual communication routes: neural (vagal) and humoral (vascular endothelial at BBB)
- Blood-borne cytokines trigger responses from vascular endothelial cells at the BBB, leading to local brain cytokine production
- Microglia provide early amplification response to immune signals
- Blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, TNF) prevents sickness behaviors
- Circumventricular organs (OVLT, area postrema) serve as interface for cytokine sensing

## Methodology
- Review article synthesizing animal and human data
- Covers neuroanatomical mechanisms, cytokine pharmacology, and behavioral outcomes

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** High (peer-reviewed review in high-impact journal)
- **Sample Size:** Review of multiple studies
- **Replication:** Well-established mechanisms
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None apparent
- **Overall:** High certainty

## Relevance to Ch15 Sec 15.4
- Covers the BBB transport and endothelial sensing mechanisms specifically requested in the TODO
- Documents microglial amplification role (relevant to TLR4/NF-kB in microglia TODO)
- Explains hypothalamic cytokine signaling mechanisms
