**DOI:** 10.1038/s41598-018-20941-w
**PMID:** 29426834

## Key Points
- n=24 ME/CFS patients matched to n=24 sedentary controls
- Cytokine profiles 18 hours post-exercise (submaximal CPET) most discriminatory between groups
- Key discriminatory markers post-exercise: CD40L, platelet activator inhibitor, IL-1beta, IFN-alpha, CXCL1
- IFN-alpha and IL-1beta specifically elevated post-exercise in ME/CFS vs. controls
- Supports PEM cytokine spike hypothesis: immune activation persists post-exercise

## Methodology
- Case-control study, n=24 ME/CFS + n=24 sedentary controls (well-matched)
- Submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)
- Multiplex cytokine profiling at baseline, during exercise, and 18h post-exercise
- SPLS-DA analysis for discriminant cytokine identification

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** High (well-matched controls, validated exercise protocol, multiplex cytokine panel)
- **Sample Size:** n=48 total (medium - borderline for biomarker studies)
- **Replication:** Single study at time of publication; consistent with Che2025 findings
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Stanford group; Montoya lab (no commercial bias)
- **Overall:** Medium-High certainty

## Relevance to Ch15 Sec 15.4
- Directly documents PEM cytokine spike: IL-1beta and IFN-alpha elevated 18h post-exercise in ME/CFS
- Links exercise-induced immune activation to the PEM cytokine surge concept
- Provides specific biomarker data for ME/CFS post-exertional immune activation
