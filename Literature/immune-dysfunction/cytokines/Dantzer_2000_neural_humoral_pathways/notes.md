**DOI:** 10.1016/S1566-0702(00)00220-4
**PMID:** 11189027

## Key Points
- Two complementary routes: (1) fast neural pathway via vagus nerve; (2) slower humoral pathway via circumventricular organs and choroid plexus
- Cytokine activation of brain neurons occurs directly or indirectly via prostaglandins
- Locally produced brain cytokines reach targets through neuronal projection or volume transmission into brain tissue
- Both pathways converge on the same hypothalamic and limbic circuits

## Methodology
- Review/conceptual paper synthesizing multiple animal experiments
- Integration of neuroanatomical tracing, pharmacological blockade, and cytokine injection studies

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** High (authoritative review by leading researchers in field)
- **Sample Size:** Review of multiple studies
- **Replication:** Foundational, extensively replicated
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None apparent
- **Overall:** High certainty for mechanistic framework

## Relevance to Ch15 Sec 15.4
- Provides the mechanistic framework for how peripheral cytokines signal the brain
- Explains the two parallel pathways: neural (vagal) and humoral (circumventricular organs + transport)
- Critical for the "blood-brain barrier transport mechanisms" TODO in sec 15.4
