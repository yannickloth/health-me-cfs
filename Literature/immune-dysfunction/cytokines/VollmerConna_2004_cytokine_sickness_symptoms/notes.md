## Key Points
- Direct quantitative relationship between peripheral IL-1beta and IL-6 and human sickness behavior symptoms
- Pathogens studied: EBV, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), Ross River virus (RRV)
- IL-1beta and IL-6 levels directly correlated with fever, malaise, pain, fatigue, mood disturbance, and poor concentration
- Establishes that peripheral cytokine production drives measurable sickness behavioral states in humans (not just animal models)

## Methodology
- Prospective cohort study of patients with documented acute infections
- Natural infection setting (EBV, Q fever, RRV)
- Cytokine measurements alongside validated symptom assessments
- Sample size: not specified in abstract; multiple infection cohorts

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** High (prospective, natural infection, multiple pathogens)
- **Sample Size:** Medium (multi-cohort, exact N unclear from abstract)
- **Replication:** Supports existing animal model data in humans
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Unclear from abstract
- **Overall:** Medium-High certainty

## Relevance to Ch15 Sec 15.4
- Directly demonstrates that IL-1beta and IL-6 produce fatigue, malaise, cognitive slowing in humans
- Quantitative correlation: higher cytokines = worse sickness symptoms
- Grounds the cytokine-fatigue hypothesis in human clinical data
