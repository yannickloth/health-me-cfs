**DOI:** 10.1186/s12883-019-1433-0
**PMID:** 31445522

## Key Points
- Systematic review of 15 observational case-control studies of cytokines in ME/CFS
- Searched 16,702 publications; 15 studies selected
- Included serum cytokines (10 studies) and cytokines in other body fluids (4 studies)
- Conclusion: "inconclusive as to whether cytokines play any definitive role in CFS/ME/SEID" as reliable diagnostic markers
- Highlights significant heterogeneity across studies (different patient populations, assay methods, timepoints)

## Methodology
- Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines
- Databases: PubMed, Scopus, Medline, EMBASE
- 15 case-control studies included

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** High (systematic review, rigorous methodology)
- **Sample Size:** 15 studies reviewed
- **Replication:** Meta-analytic conclusion of inconsistency across studies
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Griffith University group; no commercial bias apparent
- **Overall:** High certainty that cytokine findings are HETEROGENEOUS (not a single consistent profile)

## Important Nuance
This review is important for calibrating certainty: while some cytokines are elevated in subsets,
there is NO universal cytokine signature. This supports using cautious language ("in subsets") when
describing ME/CFS cytokine elevations.

## Relevance to Ch15 Sec 15.4
- Provides important limitation framing: cytokine elevations documented in subsets, not universally
- Supports the "elevated IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-alpha in subsets" phrasing in the section stub
- Justifies medium certainty rating for cytokine-fatigue claims in ME/CFS
