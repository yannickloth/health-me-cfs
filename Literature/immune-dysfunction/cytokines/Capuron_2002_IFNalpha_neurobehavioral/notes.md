## Key Points
- IFN-alpha therapy in cancer (melanoma) produces distinct early neurovegetative syndrome: fatigue, anorexia, pain appearing within 2 weeks
- Neurovegetative/somatic symptoms (fatigue, anorexia) distinct from later mood/cognitive symptoms
- Fatigue and anorexia were less responsive to paroxetine than mood symptoms, suggesting different neurobiological pathways
- Study design: double-blind RCT, 40 melanoma patients randomized to paroxetine vs. placebo during IFN-alpha therapy

## Methodology
- Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- n=40 melanoma patients receiving high-dose IFN-alpha
- 12-week follow-up with structured psychiatric assessment

## Acronym Definitions
- IFN-alpha: Interferon-alpha (cytokine used therapeutically and elevated in some ME/CFS patients)
- RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial

## Certainty Assessment
- **Study Quality:** High (double-blind RCT, published in top journal)
- **Sample Size:** n=40 (medium)
- **Replication:** IFN-alpha fatigue widely replicated across HCV and oncology trials
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Unclear from abstract
- **Overall:** High certainty for IFN-alpha as fatigue-inducing cytokine

## Relevance to Ch15 Sec 15.4
- Gold-standard evidence that IFN-alpha (one of the cytokines elevated in ME/CFS subsets) directly induces fatigue
- Demonstrates fatigue as a distinct cytokine-driven behavioral output (different mechanism from mood depression)
- Supports discussion of IFN-alpha/gamma in ME/CFS cytokine profile
