BACKGROUND: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an 
acquired complex disease with patients suffering from the cardinal symptoms of 
fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM), cognitive impairment, pain and 
autonomous dysfunction. ME/CFS is triggered by an infection in the majority of 
patients. Initial evidence for a potential role of natural regulatory 
autoantibodies (AAB) to beta-adrenergic (AdR) and muscarinic acetylcholine 
receptors (M-AChR) in ME/CFS patients comes from a few studies.
METHODS: Here, we analyzed the correlations of symptom severity with levels of 
AAB to vasoregulative AdR, AChR and Endothelin-1 type A and B (ETA/B) and 
Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor in a Berlin cohort of ME/CFS patients (n = 
116) by ELISA. The severity of disease, symptoms and autonomic dysfunction were 
assessed by questionnaires.
RESULTS: We found levels of most AABs significantly correlated with key symptoms 
of fatigue and muscle pain in patients with infection-triggered onset. The 
severity of cognitive impairment correlated with AT1-R- and ETA-R-AAB and 
severity of gastrointestinal symptoms with alpha1/2-AdR-AAB. In contrast, the 
patients with non-infection-triggered ME/CFS showed fewer and other 
correlations.
CONCLUSION: Correlations of specific AAB against G-protein-coupled receptors 
(GPCR) with symptoms provide evidence for a role of these AAB or respective 
receptor pathways in disease pathomechanism.
