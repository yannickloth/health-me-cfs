## Literature Search Results Summary

### Hypothesis 1: Glial Maturation Window

**Search completed:** Microglial maturation, adolescence, synaptic pruning, CSF-1R

**Key Papers Identified:**
1. **Nakatomi et al. (2014)** - PET imaging showing neuroinflammation in ME/CFS
   - PMID: 24665088
   - Landmark study showing 45-199% higher microglial activation

2. **Weinhard et al. (2018)** - "Microglial Pruning of Synapses in the Prefrontal Cortex During Adolescence"
   - PMID: 29668872
   - Oxford Academic / Cerebral Cortex
   - Shows transient increase in synaptic pruning during adolescence

3. **Sellgren et al. (2019)** - Microglial regulation mechanisms
   - PMC8451802, PMC8530121
   - C1q-C3-CR3 complement pathways in synaptic pruning

4. **MDPI Review (2025)** - "Microglial Maturation and Functional Heterogeneity"
   - Recent comprehensive review
   - Links to neurodevelopmental disorders

**Key Findings:**
- Microglia undergo dramatic reprogramming during adolescence
- Peak synaptic pruning occurs in prefrontal cortex around puberty
- CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor) essential for microglial survival
- Complement pathways (C1q, C3, CR3) mediate "Eat Me" signals
- CX3CR1 signaling regulates pruning activity
- Process largely complete by early 20s

**Mechanisms:**
- Activated microglia in ME/CFS may be "locked" in inflammatory state
- Adolescent pruning process may provide developmental "reset"
- Adults lack developmental signal to trigger microglial turnover
- CSF-1R inhibitors (PLX5622, pexidartinib) can force turnover

**Certainty Assessment:** Medium-Low (hypothesis based on established developmental neuroscience applied to ME/CFS context)

### Hypothesis 2: HSC Exhaustion

**Search completed:** Hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion, aging, chronic disease

**Key Papers Identified:**
1. **Yamashita & Passegué (2020)** - "Protection of hematopoietic stem cells from stress-induced exhaustion"
   - PMID: 32398455
   - Current Opinion in Hematology

2. **Geiger & Rudolph (2018)** - "Aging of hematopoietic stem cells"
   - Blood journal review
   - Comprehensive aging mechanisms

3. **Kovtonyuk et al. (2022)** - "Mechanisms involved in hematopoietic stem cell aging"
   - PMC11072869
   - Cell. Mol. Life Sci.

4. **Multiple reviews (2020-2024)** on inflammation and HSC aging

**Key Findings:**
- HSCs undergo accelerated exhaustion under chronic stress (infection, inflammation, BMT)
- Mechanisms include: DNA damage, epigenetics, metabolism changes, polarity shifts
- Chronic low-grade inflammation ("inflamm-aging") impairs HSC function
- Aged HSCs show clonal competition → hematologic malignancies, CVD risk
- 2-4x increase in IL-1, IL-6, TNF with aging
- Immunosenescence from impaired HSC→immune cell production

**Connection to ME/CFS:**
- Initial infection triggers massive immune expansion (draws on HSC reserves)
- Repeated crashes cause additional depletion waves
- Children have larger HSC pools + higher regenerative capacity
- Progressive HSC decline in adults (disease + aging synergize)
- Eventually cannot regenerate healthy immune cells

**Biomarkers:**
- CD34+ circulating progenitors
- HSC clonality (diversity index)
- Telomere length in HSC compartment
- Single-cell RNA-seq signatures

**Certainty Assessment:** Medium (established HSC biology + ME/CFS clinical observations)

### Hypothesis 3: Immune Memory Pruning

**Search completed:** B cell tolerance, peripheral tolerance, development, adolescence

**Key Papers Identified:**
1. **Cancro (2020)** - "B Cell Development and Maturation"
   - PMID: 32323265

2. **Cashman & Jenks (2022)** - "The role of inhibitory signaling in peripheral B cell tolerance"
   - PMC8986582

3. **Pelanda & Torres (2012/2023)** - "Mechanisms of central tolerance for B cells"
   - PMC5623591, Updated discussions

4. **Multiple 2023-2024 reviews** on B cell tolerance mechanisms

**Key Findings:**
- B cells undergo both central (bone marrow) and peripheral tolerance
- Central mechanisms: receptor editing, clonal deletion
- Peripheral mechanisms: anergy, clonal deletion, suppression
- ~20% of peripheral B cells show some self-reactivity
- Regulatory B cells (Bregs) produce IL-10 to suppress responses
- Hormones influence B cell development (Frontiers Immunol. 2024)

**Hypothesis:**
- Pubertal immune reorganization includes "quality control" checkpoints
- Developing immune systems actively delete aberrant memory cells
- Autoreactive B cells undergo receptor editing or apoptosis during adolescence
- Adults lack these developmental tolerance signals
- Result: Autoantibodies persist in adults, cleared in children

**Testable Predictions:**
- Declining autoantibody titers in recovering children vs. stable in adults
- Gene signatures of active tolerance mechanisms in pediatric samples
- Correlation of tolerance markers (Breg frequency, IL-10) with recovery

**Certainty Assessment:** Low-Medium (novel hypothesis, needs direct testing)

### Hypothesis 4: EBV-Adolescence Connection

**Search completed:** EBV, adolescence, infectious mononucleosis, autoantibodies, GPCR

**Key Papers Identified:**
1. **Frontera & Kaltsas (2020)** - "Epstein-Barr Virus and Systemic Autoimmune Diseases"
   - PMC7817975
   - Frontiers in Immunology

2. **Dunmire et al. (2022)** - "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV): Biology and Clinical Disease"
   - PMC9529843

3. **Recent 2025 papers on:**
   - GPCR autoantibodies in post-COVID and ME/CFS
   - EBV-encoded GPCR BILF1 functions
   - EBI2/GPR183 in B cell migration

4. **IL-27 autoantibodies** in infectious mononucleosis

**Key Findings:**
- EBV causes mono in 35-50% of adolescent/young adult infections
- EBV infection stimulates multiple autoantibodies (anti-nuclear, RF, anti-I)
- IL-27 neutralizing autoantibodies in most sporadic mono cases
- EBV encodes GPCR (BILF1) that couples to Gi signaling
- EBI2/GPR183 regulates B cell migration during immune responses
- GPCR autoantibodies elevated in ME/CFS subgroup, correlate with severity

**Hypothesis:**
- EBV infects B cells during pubertal immune maturation
- Creates abnormal memory B cell populations producing GPCR autoantibodies
- Timing determines outcome:
  - Young children: Ongoing development may clear aberrant clones
  - Adolescents: Populations persist at edge of maturation window
  - Adults: Without renewal mechanisms, become permanent

**Treatment Implications:**
- B cell depletion (rituximab) particularly effective in adolescents/young adults
- Timing matters: Earlier intervention may prevent establishment

**Certainty Assessment:** Medium-Low (established EBV biology + ME/CFS associations, mechanistic link speculative)

### Hypothesis 5: OI as Lynchpin

**Search completed:** Orthostatic intolerance, POTS, pediatric treatment, ME/CFS outcomes

**Key Papers Identified:**
1. **Pediatrics (2022)** - "Pediatric Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome: Where We Stand"
   - AAP official review

2. **Clinical studies** on ivabradine in pediatric POTS (n=27, ages 12-17)
   - Significantly decreased heart rate
   - Reduced palpitations, fatigue, syncope, lightheadedness

3. **Stewart et al.** - Matched case-control in pediatric ME/CFS with OI

4. **2021 study** - "Deconditioning does not explain orthostatic intolerance in ME/CFS"
   - Journal of Translational Medicine

**Key Findings:**
- OI symptoms (POTS) significantly impair function in ME/CFS, especially adolescents
- Non-pharmacological: increase salt/fluids, avoid triggers, compression garments
- Pharmacological: ivabradine effective in pediatric cohort
- Treatment of OI can improve fatigue, cognition, wellbeing (not just cardiovascular)
- Mayo Clinic: comprehensive interdisciplinary approach improves POTS in adolescents

**Hypothesis:**
- In early disease, autonomic dysfunction (OI) may be PRIMARY driver
- Other systems (immune, metabolic, neuroimmune) secondarily affected
- Early aggressive OI treatment might prevent "spread" to other systems
- Pediatric data supports: OI treatment → broad symptom improvement

**Clinical Implications:**
- Position OI as upstream driver in septad framework
- Justify aggressive OI treatment in early-stage adult patients
- May explain why some pediatric patients recover with OI-focused treatment

**Certainty Assessment:** Medium (based on clinical observations, mechanistic cascade speculative)
