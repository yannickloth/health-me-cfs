# Luc Biland Long COVID Recovery Resources

Documentation of Luc Biland's Long COVID recovery case and his treatment approach, particularly the use of cimetidine for EBV reactivation.

## Source Overview

This folder contains resources from Luc Biland's website (lucbiland.ch) documenting his personal recovery from Long COVID and his subsequent advocacy work.

## Key Case Details

**Patient:** Luc Biland, 22 years old, Birmenstorf, Switzerland
**Occupation:** Works at ZT Fachmessen (family business)
**Duration of illness:** 2.5 years
**Primary symptom:** Severe exhaustion requiring most of day sleeping
**Pattern:** Relapsing-remitting course with repeated crashes

### Clinical Timeline

1. **Initial COVID infection** → Developed Long COVID
2. **2.5 years of severe illness** with relapses
3. **Self-research** → Discovered EBV reactivation literature
4. **EBV testing** → Confirmed EBV reactivation via PCR
5. **Cimetidine trial** (under physician supervision):
   - Day 2: Flu-like symptoms
   - Day 5: Significant improvement, returned to work
   - Duration: 15 days total
   - **Result: Complete recovery maintained after stopping medication**

### Mechanism Hypothesis

**EBV Reactivation in Long COVID:**
- 60-70% of Long COVID cases show EBV reactivation (per multiple international studies cited)
- Standard serologic tests miss reactivation (only detect primary infection)
- EBV-PCR testing needed but rarely ordered by primary care
- ~95% of population over 30 carries latent EBV

**Cimetidine Mechanism:**
- Originally: H2 receptor antagonist (gastric acid blocker)
- **Immunomodulatory effects:** Enhances cell-mediated immunity
- Historical evidence: Goldstein 1986 reported success in chronic EBV infections
- Now replaced by newer H2 blockers without immunomodulatory properties
- **Not available in Switzerland** (discontinued for commercial reasons, not safety)

### Supporting Case

**Joel Gisin** (work colleague):
- Unexplained exhaustion
- Tested positive for EBV reactivation on Biland's recommendation
- Symptoms resolved after cimetidine treatment

### Patient's Subjective Description

> "Es fühlte sich an, als wäre ich lebendig begraben. Als wäre ich im Koma, aber gleichzeitig bei voller Wahrnehmung."
>
> (Translation: "It felt like I was buried alive. As if I was in a coma, but simultaneously with full awareness.")

## Diagnostic Recommendations (from Biland's resources)

### Core Pathophysiological Mechanisms

1. **EBV Reactivation:** Weakened TH1 response (TH2 shift) → viral reactivation
2. **Oxidative Stress:** ROS/antioxidant imbalance → cell damage, chronic inflammation
3. **Tryptophan Metabolism:** Serotonin/kynurenine dysregulation → neurological symptoms
4. **Energy Metabolism:** Insulin/glucagon dysregulation → fatigue
5. **TH2/Histamine Dominance:** Overactive TH2 → inflammation, mast cell activation

### Recommended Testing

**Oxidative Stress Panel:**
- Superoxide dismutase (SOD)
- Glutathione (GSH and GSSG)
- Lipid peroxidation (8-ISO-Prostaglandin)

**EBV Diagnostics:**
- Serologie: Anti-VCA-IgG, Anti-VCA-IgM, Anti-EBNA-1-IgG
- **EBV-PCR** (critical for detecting reactivation)

**Additional:**
- Immune status (TH1/TH2 balance)
- Tryptophan metabolism (serotonin, kynurenin)

**Recommended Laboratory:** Tägerwilen
**Recommended Physician:** Dr. Michaela Fux (www.immunologin.ch)

### Dietary Observations (Preliminary)

> "Viele Betroffene stark auf Zucker und Kohlenhydrate reagieren, welche möglicherweise Symptome verschlechtern."

Many patients react strongly to sugar and carbohydrates, which may worsen symptoms. Sugar reduction could provide initial relief.

## Advocacy Efforts

- **1500+ emails sent** to physicians and health authorities
- Goal: Promote research on EBV-cimetidine connection in Long COVID
- **Limited response to date** despite personal success
- Advocates for: Better physician education, EBV-PCR testing, official recognition of Long COVID

## Clinical Limitations Noted

1. **Diagnostic gaps:** Standard tests miss EBV reactivation
2. **Knowledge gaps:** Most primary care physicians lack awareness
3. **Access barriers:**
   - Immunology specialists have 1-year wait times (University Hospital Zurich)
   - Cimetidine not available in Switzerland
4. **Recognition gaps:** Long COVID not officially recognized → financial hardship for patients
5. **Research gaps:** No controlled studies on cimetidine for Long COVID

## Responder Profile (Biland's Website Data)

**Success rate: ~5/300 patients (~1.7%)**

Dramatic responders likely have:
- EBV reactivation as **primary or sole driver** of symptoms
- Responds to cimetidine alone or combined with valacyclovir
- **Ineffective in severe cases** where oxidative stress dominates initial presentation

## Relevance to ME/CFS

### Overlapping Features
- Post-infectious onset
- Severe exhaustion
- Relapsing-remitting pattern
- Post-exertional symptom exacerbation (crashes)
- Multi-system involvement
- Limited effective treatments

### Distinguishing Features (This Case)
- Clear viral trigger (COVID-19)
- Confirmed EBV reactivation
- **Dramatic response to single intervention** (unusual for ME/CFS)
- **Complete recovery** (rare in ME/CFS)
- Short duration (2.5 years vs. often decades in ME/CFS)

### Clinical Implications for ME/CFS
- EBV reactivation may be treatable subset
- Standard serology insufficient - need PCR
- Cimetidine: Consider in EBV+ patients who failed antivirals alone
- Oxidative stress testing may identify responders
- TH1/TH2 imbalance assessment relevant

## Integration into ME/CFS Documentation

**Relevant chapters:**
- Viral reactivation mechanisms
- Immune dysfunction (TH1/TH2 shift)
- Treatment approaches (antivirals, immunomodulators)
- Diagnostic testing (EBV-PCR, oxidative stress)
- Case reports (dramatic responder phenotype)

**Evidence certainty:** VERY LOW (anecdotal case reports, no controlled trials)

**Clinical recommendation:** INVESTIGATIONAL - requires controlled validation

## Notes

- All resources in German

- His website emphasizes diagnostic-first approach
- Explicitly cautions against overestimating cimetidine effectiveness (most patients do not respond)
- Advocates for research, not self-medication
