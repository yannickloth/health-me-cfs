Reference values of four measures of craniocervical stability using upright dynamic magnetic resonance imaging

Background: Establishment of updated reference ranges for CCI measurements using upright dynamic MRI in healthy adults.

Methods: n=50 healthy adults (25 male, 25 female, age 18-65) underwent upright dynamic MRI (sitting position) with flexion, neutral, and extension views. Four key measurements taken:
1. Grabb-Oakes line (ventral brainstem compression)
2. Clivo-axial angle (cranial settling)
3. Basion-dens interval (craniocervical instability)
4. Atlantodens interval (atlantoaxial stability)

Key Findings - Reference Ranges (mean ± SD, upper limit):

Grabb-Oakes Line:
- Neutral: 4.2 ± 1.8 mm (upper limit: 7.8 mm)
- Flexion: 5.1 ± 2.1 mm (upper limit: 9.3 mm)
- Extension: 3.6 ± 1.5 mm (upper limit: 6.6 mm)

Clivo-axial Angle:
- Neutral: 151 ± 8° (lower limit: 135°)
- Flexion: 145 ± 9° (lower limit: 127°)
- Extension: 157 ± 7° (lower limit: 143°)

Basion-dens Interval:
- Neutral: 7.1 ± 1.6 mm (upper limit: 10.3 mm)
- Flexion: 8.3 ± 1.8 mm (upper limit: 11.9 mm)
- Extension: 6.2 ± 1.4 mm (upper limit: 9.0 mm)

Atlantodens Interval:
- Neutral: 1.8 ± 0.6 mm (upper limit: 3.0 mm)
- All positions: <3 mm in all subjects

Implications:
- Updated reference ranges for upright dynamic imaging
- Previous thresholds (from supine imaging) may be too strict
- Dynamic measurements show significant variation with position
- Age and sex did not significantly affect measurements

Clinical Relevance:
- Provides evidence-based thresholds for CCI diagnosis
- Highlights importance of imaging position
- Dynamic views capture instability missed on static imaging
- Should be used to interpret findings in EDS/ME/CFS populations
