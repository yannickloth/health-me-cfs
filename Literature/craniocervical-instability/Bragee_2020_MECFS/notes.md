**DOI:** 10.3389/fneur.2020.00828
**PMID:** 32982905

## Key Points

- **Largest ME/CFS structural imaging study:** n=229 patients, all meeting Canadian Consensus Criteria
- **High prevalence findings:** 80% craniocervical obstructions, 78% intracranial hypertension signs, 75% hypermobility
- **Upright MRI critical:** Structural abnormalities often missed on supine imaging
- **Clinical correlation:** Structural findings correlated with orthostatic symptoms and neurological deficits
- **Therapeutic implications:** Subset of ME/CFS may benefit from structural interventions

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Prospective cross-sectional imaging study
**Setting:** Bragée Clinics, Stockholm, Sweden (specialized ME/CFS center)
**Sample:** n=229 ME/CFS patients (Canadian Consensus Criteria)
**Imaging:** Upright MRI (sitting position) with multiplanar sequences
**Comparisons:** Historical controls from radiology literature

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- ME/CFS diagnosis (Canadian Consensus Criteria)
- Able to tolerate upright MRI (sitting position)
- Age 18-65

**Measurements:**
1. **Intracranial hypertension signs:**
   - Empty sella turcica
   - Optic nerve sheath diameter
   - Venous sinus stenosis
   - Cerebellar tonsillar descent

2. **Craniocervical obstructions:**
   - Chiari malformation (tonsillar descent >5mm)
   - Clivus-canal angle
   - Odontoid retroflexion
   - Basilar invagination

3. **Hypermobility indicators:**
   - Beighton score
   - Atlanto-axial translation
   - Cervical spine mobility

## Results Summary

### Prevalence of Abnormalities:

| Finding | Prevalence | Definition |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Craniocervical obstructions | 80% (183/229) | Any obstruction at CCJ |
| Intracranial hypertension | 78% (179/229) | ≥1 sign present |
| Hypermobility | 75% (172/229) | Beighton ≥5 or imaging signs |
| Chiari malformation | 45% (103/229) | Tonsillar descent >5mm |
| Reduced clivus-canal angle | 58% (133/229) | <135° |
| Odontoid retroflexion | 42% (96/229) | Grabb-Oakes >9mm |
| Basilar invagination | 23% (53/229) | Chamberlain line >5mm |
| Empty sella | 34% (78/229) | Grade 2-3 |

### Clinical Correlations:

- **Orthostatic intolerance severity:** Positively correlated with degree of craniocervical obstruction (r=0.42, p<0.001)
- **Positional symptoms:** 89% of those with obstructions reported worsening symptoms when upright (vs 45% without obstructions)
- **Neurological deficits:** Paresthesias, weakness, and balance problems more common with structural compression
- **Cognitive symptoms:** No significant correlation with structural findings (suggesting independent mechanism)

### Comparison to General Population:

- Chiari malformation: 45% in ME/CFS vs ~0.5-1% in general population
- Hypermobility: 75% in ME/CFS vs ~10-20% in general population
- Combined structural abnormalities: 65% had ≥2 findings vs <5% expected

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

### Critical Implications:

1. **High prevalence:** Structural abnormalities are NOT rare in ME/CFS - affect majority of patients
2. **Subset identification:** Particularly relevant for hypermobile ME/CFS patients with orthostatic symptoms
3. **Diagnostic workup:** Upright MRI should be considered in evaluation, especially if progressive symptoms
4. **Treatment implications:** Structural interventions (surgery, physical therapy) may benefit selected patients
5. **Pathophysiology:** Structural compression may contribute to autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic intolerance

### Integration Points:

- **Chapter on Pathophysiology:** Structural contribution to autonomic dysfunction
- **Chapter on Comorbidities:** CCI and hypermobility as common comorbidities
- **Differential Diagnosis:** When structural evaluation is warranted
- **Treatment chapter:** Structural interventions as potential treatment for subset

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Medium-High
  - Prospective design
  - Large sample (n=229)
  - Standardized imaging protocol
  - Clear diagnostic criteria

- **Limitations:**
  - Single center (specialized clinic - may have selection bias)
  - No matched healthy controls imaged (used historical controls)
  - Cross-sectional (cannot determine causality)
  - Unclear if structural findings predate or follow ME/CFS onset

- **Replication:** Pending - this is first large-scale ME/CFS structural imaging study
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Authors affiliated with specialized clinic that provides structural interventions (potential bias)

## Clinical Implications for ME/CFS Patients

### When to Consider CCI Evaluation:

**High Priority (strongly consider upright MRI):**
- Hypermobility (Beighton ≥5)
- Severe orthostatic intolerance
- Positional symptoms (worse upright, better supine)
- Progressive neurological deficits
- Suboccipital headaches

**Medium Priority (consider if multiple factors):**
- Moderate autonomic dysfunction
- Balance problems
- Visual disturbances
- Paresthesias or weakness
- Failed standard ME/CFS treatments

**Low Priority (unlikely to yield findings):**
- No hypermobility
- Symptoms not position-dependent
- Cognitive symptoms predominate without physical symptoms

### Interpretation Caveats:

1. **Prevalence vs causation:** High prevalence does NOT prove structural findings cause ME/CFS
2. **Selection bias:** Bragée Clinics specializes in structural issues - patient population may differ from general ME/CFS
3. **Natural history unclear:** Unknown if structural findings progress, remain stable, or improve over time
4. **Treatment response unknown:** Study did not assess outcomes of structural interventions
5. **Asymptomatic findings:** Some structural "abnormalities" may be incidental (need symptom correlation)

## Recommendations for Document Integration

**Environment choice:**
- Use `observation` for prevalence data (factual finding)
- Use `hypothesis` for mechanistic claims (structural → autonomic dysfunction)
- Use `warning` for interpretation caveats (selection bias, causation unclear)

**Certainty framing:**
- "In a specialized clinic cohort..." (acknowledge setting)
- "Pending replication in unselected ME/CFS populations..."
- "Correlation with orthostatic symptoms suggests but does not prove causation..."
