Signs of Intracranial Hypertension, Hypermobility, and Craniocervical Obstructions in Patients With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Background: This study investigated structural abnormalities at the craniocervical junction in ME/CFS patients using upright MRI.

Methods: Prospective imaging study of 229 ME/CFS patients (Canadian Consensus Criteria) using upright MRI. Measurements included signs of intracranial hypertension, craniocervical obstructions, and hypermobility indicators.

Key Findings:
- 80% (183/229) had craniocervical obstructions
- 78% (179/229) had signs of intracranial hypertension
- 75% (172/229) met criteria for hypermobility
- Strong association between hypermobility and structural abnormalities

Specific Findings:
- Cerebellar tonsillar descent (Chiari malformation): 45%
- Reduced clivus-canal angle: 58%
- Increased odontoid retroflexion: 42%
- Basilar invagination: 23%

Clinical Correlations:
- Structural abnormalities correlated with severity of orthostatic intolerance
- Positional symptoms (worse upright) more common in those with obstructions
- Neurological symptoms (paresthesias, weakness) associated with degree of compression

Implications:
- High prevalence of structural abnormalities in ME/CFS
- Upright imaging critical (supine MRI may miss these findings)
- Subset of ME/CFS may have structural component to symptoms
- Potential therapeutic target in selected patients
