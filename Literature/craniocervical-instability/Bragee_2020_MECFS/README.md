## Quick Summary

First large-scale structural imaging study in ME/CFS (n=229) using upright MRI. Found 80% had craniocervical obstructions, 78% had intracranial hypertension signs, and 75% had hypermobility. Structural findings correlated with orthostatic intolerance severity.

## Why This Matters for ME/CFS

- **First large-scale structural study:** No prior ME/CFS study had systematically evaluated craniocervical pathology
- **High prevalence:** Structural abnormalities common, not rare, in ME/CFS (especially hypermobile subset)
- **Clinical correlation:** Findings associated with orthostatic symptoms, suggesting mechanistic contribution
- **Therapeutic implications:** Subset may benefit from structural interventions
- **Diagnostic guidance:** Establishes when upright MRI evaluation is warranted

## Key Takeaways

1. 80% of ME/CFS patients had craniocervical obstructions (vs <5% expected in general population)
2. 45% had Chiari malformation (vs 0.5-1% general population)
3. Upright MRI critical - supine imaging misses many findings
4. Structural findings correlated with orthostatic intolerance (r=0.42, p<0.001)
5. Particularly relevant for hypermobile subset (75% of cohort)

## Important Caveats

**Selection Bias:** Bragée Clinics specializes in structural pathology - patient population may not represent general ME/CFS

**No Imaging Controls:** Used historical controls from literature, not matched healthy subjects with upright MRI

**Pending Replication:** First study of its kind; independent confirmation needed

**Causation Unclear:** High prevalence does not prove structural findings cause ME/CFS symptoms

**Conflict of Interest:** Authors affiliated with clinic providing structural interventions

## Evidence Quality

**Strengths:**
- Large sample (n=229)
- Prospective design
- Standardized imaging protocol
- Clear diagnostic criteria (Canadian Consensus)
- Strong clinical correlations

**Limitations:**
- Single specialized center
- No matched controls
- Cross-sectional (cannot determine temporal relationship)
- Potential selection bias
- Pending independent replication

**Overall Rating:** Medium certainty (large sample, prospective, but selection bias concerns)

## Integration Recommendations

- Use `observation` for prevalence data
- Use `warning` for selection bias and interpretation limits
- Use `hypothesis` for mechanistic claims (structural → autonomic dysfunction)
- Always mention specialized clinic setting
- Frame as "pending replication in unselected populations"
- Emphasize relevance to hypermobile subset
