Craniocervical Instability in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome—A Systematic Review of Diagnostic and Surgical Treatment Criteria

Background: Craniocervical instability (CCI) is increasingly recognized in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), particularly hypermobile EDS (hEDS). This systematic review synthesizes current diagnostic criteria and surgical treatment approaches.

Methods: Systematic review of 16 studies including 695 EDS patients with suspected or confirmed CCI. Analysis of diagnostic imaging criteria (static and dynamic MRI, CT), clinical presentation, and surgical outcomes.

Key Findings:
- Multiple diagnostic measurement systems exist (Grabb-Oakes, clivo-axial angle, atlantodens interval, etc.)
- Significant heterogeneity in diagnostic thresholds across studies
- Surgical intervention (occipito-cervical fusion) shows positive outcomes when properly indicated
- Need for standardized diagnostic criteria is critical

Diagnostic Challenges:
- No consensus on single "gold standard" measurement
- Reference ranges vary between studies
- Dynamic imaging (upright, flexion-extension) provides more information than supine static MRI
- Clinical presentation must correlate with imaging findings

Clinical Presentation:
- Headaches (often suboccipital)
- Neck pain and instability
- Neurological symptoms (paresthesias, weakness)
- Autonomic dysfunction
- Cognitive difficulties
- Balance problems

Implications for EDS/ME/CFS:
- Many ME/CFS patients have comorbid EDS or hypermobility
- CCI may contribute to symptom burden in subset of patients
- Screening for structural abnormalities warranted in hypermobile patients with progressive neurological symptoms
