## Quick Summary

Systematic review of 16 studies (n=695 EDS patients) examining diagnostic criteria and surgical outcomes for craniocervical instability (CCI) in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Found significant heterogeneity in diagnostic approaches but positive surgical outcomes when properly indicated.

## Why This Matters for ME/CFS

- **Comorbidity overlap:** 20-40% of ME/CFS patients have hypermobile EDS or joint hypermobility
- **Symptom overlap:** CCI symptoms (fatigue, cognitive issues, autonomic dysfunction) overlap with ME/CFS
- **Differential diagnosis:** CCI is structural and potentially treatable; should be considered in hypermobile patients
- **Screening guidance:** Establishes when imaging evaluation is warranted

## Key Takeaways

1. No consensus on diagnostic criteria - multiple measurement systems exist
2. Dynamic upright MRI superior to supine static imaging
3. Clinical correlation essential - imaging alone insufficient
4. Surgical outcomes positive (60-80% improvement) in selected cases
5. Conservative management should be first-line approach

## Evidence Quality

**Strengths:**
- Systematic review methodology (PRISMA)
- Large aggregate sample (n=695)
- Multiple independent studies

**Limitations:**
- High heterogeneity between studies
- Selection bias (neurosurgical centers)
- No RCTs
- Limited long-term data

**Overall Rating:** Medium-High certainty
