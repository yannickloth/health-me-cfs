# Craniocervical Instability in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome—A Systematic Review

**Authors:** Lohkamp, Luke-Norman; Marathe, Nikhita; Fehlings, Michael G.
**Journal:** Global Spine Journal, 2022, Volume 12, Pages 1862-1871
**DOI:** 10.1177/21925682211068520

## Key Points

- **Systematic review scope:** 16 studies, 695 EDS patients with suspected/confirmed CCI
- **Heterogeneity problem:** Significant variation in diagnostic criteria and measurement thresholds across studies
- **Multiple measurement systems:** Grabb-Oakes line, clivo-axial angle (CXA), atlantodens interval (ADI), basion-dens interval (BDI), Powers ratio, etc.
- **Dynamic imaging superiority:** Upright and flexion-extension MRI provides more diagnostic information than supine static imaging
- **Clinical correlation required:** Imaging findings must correlate with clinical symptoms for diagnosis

## Methodology

Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. Searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies on CCI in EDS populations. Included studies with diagnostic imaging criteria, clinical presentation data, and/or surgical outcomes. Quality assessment using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

**Inclusion criteria:**
- EDS patients (any subtype)
- Imaging studies (MRI, CT, X-ray)
- Diagnostic criteria or surgical outcomes reported

**Exclusion criteria:**
- Case reports (<3 patients)
- Studies without clear diagnostic criteria
- Non-EDS populations

## Results Summary

### Diagnostic Measurements (Common Thresholds):

1. **Grabb-Oakes line:** >9mm indicates ventral brainstem compression
2. **Clivo-axial angle (CXA):** <135° suggests cranial settling
3. **Atlantodens interval (ADI):** >3mm in adults indicates atlantoaxial instability
4. **Basion-dens interval (BDI):** >8.5mm suggests craniocervical instability
5. **Powers ratio:** >1.0 indicates anterior atlanto-occipital dislocation

### Clinical Presentation (Most Common Symptoms):

- Suboccipital headaches (75-90%)
- Neck pain (70-85%)
- Paresthesias (60-75%)
- Balance disturbances (55-70%)
- Cognitive difficulties (50-65%)
- Autonomic symptoms (45-60%)
- Visual disturbances (40-55%)

### Surgical Outcomes:

Studies reporting surgical intervention (occipito-cervical fusion) showed:
- Improvement in pain: 60-80% of patients
- Improvement in neurological symptoms: 55-75%
- Complication rates: 15-25% (mainly hardware-related)
- Fusion rates: 85-95%

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

### Direct Relevance:

1. **Comorbidity overlap:** Estimated 20-40% of ME/CFS patients have hypermobile EDS or joint hypermobility syndrome
2. **Symptom overlap:** CCI symptoms (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, autonomic issues) overlap significantly with ME/CFS
3. **Differential diagnosis:** CCI is a structural, potentially treatable cause that should be considered in ME/CFS patients with hypermobility
4. **Screening indication:** ME/CFS patients with progressive neurological symptoms and hypermobility warrant imaging evaluation

### Integration Points:

- **Chapter on Comorbidities:** CCI as structural comorbidity in hypermobile ME/CFS patients
- **Differential Diagnosis section:** When to screen for CCI
- **Symptom overlap discussion:** Distinguishing CCI from primary ME/CFS symptoms
- **Appendix on imaging:** Diagnostic criteria summary

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (systematic review, PRISMA methodology, 695 patients across 16 studies)
- **Evidence Level:** Level 2 (systematic review of observational studies, no RCTs)
- **Heterogeneity:** HIGH - major limitation; diagnostic criteria vary significantly between studies
- **Applicability to ME/CFS:** Medium - directly relevant to hypermobile subset, less so to non-hypermobile patients
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None declared

## Limitations

1. **No standardized diagnostic criteria:** Each study used different thresholds
2. **Selection bias:** Most studies from specialized neurosurgical centers (severe cases)
3. **Limited long-term outcomes:** Follow-up periods typically <3 years
4. **Heterogeneous EDS subtypes:** Most studies combined hEDS with classical EDS
5. **Publication bias:** Positive surgical outcomes may be over-represented

## Quotes for Citation

> "There is currently no consensus on the diagnostic criteria for craniocervical instability in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, leading to significant heterogeneity in both diagnosis and treatment." (p. 1862)

> "The use of dynamic imaging, including upright MRI and flexion-extension studies, appears to provide superior diagnostic information compared to traditional supine imaging." (p. 1867)

> "Clinical correlation is essential; imaging findings alone are insufficient for diagnosis, as many asymptomatic individuals may have measurements outside reference ranges." (p. 1869)

## Clinical Implications for ME/CFS Patients

1. **Screening threshold:** Consider CCI evaluation in ME/CFS patients with:
   - Hypermobility (Beighton score ≥5)
   - Progressive neurological symptoms
   - Positional headaches or neck pain
   - Autonomic dysfunction worsening with upright posture

2. **Imaging recommendations:** If screening indicated:
   - Upright MRI preferred over supine
   - Dynamic (flexion-extension) views add diagnostic value
   - Multiple measurements should be used (not single criterion)

3. **Specialist referral:** Neurosurgery or specialized CCI clinic if:
   - Multiple imaging abnormalities
   - Progressive symptoms despite conservative management
   - Myelopathy signs (weakness, spasticity, pathological reflexes)
