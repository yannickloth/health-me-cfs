Craniocervical instability in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: outcomes analysis following occipito-cervical fusion

Background: Retrospective analysis of surgical outcomes in EDS patients who underwent occipito-cervical fusion for symptomatic craniocervical instability.

Methods: n=53 EDS patients (predominantly hEDS) who underwent occipito-cervical fusion for CCI. Outcomes assessed using validated instruments including NDI (Neck Disability Index), VAS pain scores, and neurological examination. Mean follow-up 18 months.

Key Findings:
- Pain improvement: 71% of patients (mean VAS reduction from 7.8 to 3.2)
- Functional improvement: 68% (mean NDI improvement from 58% to 28%)
- Neurological improvement: 65% (weakness, paresthesias, balance)
- Complication rate: 19% (mainly hardware-related)
- Reoperation rate: 11%
- Patient satisfaction: 77% would repeat surgery

Predictors of Good Outcomes:
- Younger age at surgery (<40 years)
- Shorter symptom duration (<5 years)
- Correlation between imaging severity and symptoms
- Absence of severe comorbid conditions

Complications:
- Hardware failure: 8%
- CSF leak: 4%
- Infection: 3%
- Adjacent segment disease: 4%

Implications:
- Surgical intervention can be effective for properly selected EDS patients with CCI
- Patient selection critical - best outcomes when imaging correlates with symptoms
- Complication rates acceptable but significant
- Long-term follow-up needed
