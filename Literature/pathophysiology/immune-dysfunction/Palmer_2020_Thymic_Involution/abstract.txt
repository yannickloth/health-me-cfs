Immune system aging is characterized by the paradox of immunosenescence 
(insufficiency) and inflammaging (over-reaction), which incorporate two sides of 
the same coin, resulting in immune disorder. Immunosenescence refers to 
disruption in the structural architecture of immune organs and dysfunction in 
immune responses, resulting from both aged innate and adaptive immunity. 
Inflammaging, described as a chronic, sterile, systemic inflammatory condition 
associated with advanced age, is mainly attributed to somatic cellular 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and age-related autoimmune 
predisposition. However, the inability to reduce senescent somatic cells (SSCs), 
because of immunosenescence, exacerbates inflammaging. Age-related adaptive 
immune system deviations, particularly altered T cell function, are derived from 
age-related thymic atrophy or involution, a hallmark of thymic aging. Recently, 
there have been major developments in understanding how age-related thymic 
involution contributes to inflammaging and immunosenescence at the cellular and 
molecular levels, including genetic and epigenetic regulation, as well as 
developments of many potential rejuvenation strategies. Herein, we discuss the 
research progress uncovering how age-related thymic involution contributes to 
immunosenescence and inflammaging, as well as their intersection. We also 
describe how T cell adaptive immunity mediates inflammaging and plays a crucial 
role in the progression of age-related neurological and cardiovascular diseases, 
as well as cancer. We then briefly outline the underlying cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of age-related thymic involution, and finally summarize potential 
rejuvenation strategies to restore aged thymic function.
