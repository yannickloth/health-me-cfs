Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME) is a severe, 
debilitating disease, with substantial evidence pointing to immune dysregulation 
as a key contributor to pathophysiology. To characterize the gene regulatory 
state underlying T cell dysregulation in ME, we performed multiomic analysis 
across T cell subsets by integrating single-cell RNA-seq, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq 
and further analyzed CD8+ T cell subpopulations following symptom provocation. 
Specific subsets of CD8+ T cells, as well as certain innate T cells, displayed 
the most pronounced dysregulation in ME. We observed upregulation of key 
transcription factors associated with T cell exhaustion in CD8+ T cell effector 
memory subsets, as well as an altered chromatin landscape and metabolic 
reprogramming consistent with an exhausted immune cell state. To validate these 
observations, we analyzed expression of exhaustion markers using flow cytometry, 
detecting a higher frequency of exhaustion-associated factors. Together, these 
data identify T cell exhaustion as a component of ME, a finding which may 
provide a basis for future therapies, such as checkpoint blockade, metabolic 
interventions, or drugs that target chronic viral infections.
