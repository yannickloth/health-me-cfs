## Key Points

### Diagnostic Framework
- Defines **MCAS as chronic aberrant mast cell activation** without gross neoplasia
- Presents **"consensus-2" diagnostic framework** (differs from "consensus-1")
- Emphasizes that diagnostic approaches differ in patient inclusion rates

### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence: up to 17% of general population** may have some form of mast cell disorder
- Likely underdiagnosed
- **Most MCAS patients can identify effective treatment** for sustained improvement

### Relevance to ME/CFS
- MCAS is a key component of Dr. Kaufman's "Septad" framework
- Frequently co-occurs with ME/CFS, POTS, and EDS
- Treatment (mast cell stabilizers) can improve ME/CFS symptoms in affected patients

## Authors
52 international experts on mast cell disorders including:
- Lawrence B. Afrin (lead author)
- David L. Kaufman (ME/CFS specialist)
- Peter C. Rowe (Johns Hopkins)
- Ilene S. Ruhoy (Unraveled podcast co-host)

## Significance
- Authoritative diagnostic framework for MCAS
- Critical for identifying MCAS in ME/CFS patients
- Provides treatment guidance for this key comorbidity

## Certainty Assessment
- **Quality:** High (52 international expert consensus)
- **Status:** Diagnostic criteria still evolving (consensus-1 vs. consensus-2 differences)
- **Note:** Some controversy in mast cell community about diagnostic thresholds

## Integration Points
- Chapter on Comorbidities (MCAS section)
- Chapter on Subgroups (Septad framework)
- Chapter on Immune Dysfunction
- Chapter on Treatment (mast cell stabilizers)
