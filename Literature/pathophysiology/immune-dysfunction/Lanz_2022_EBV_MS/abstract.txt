Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human lymphotropic herpesvirus with a 
well-established causal role in several cancers. Recent studies have provided 
compelling epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for a causal role of EBV in 
multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory and 
neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system and is thought to be 
triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by an infectious agent, with 
EBV as the lead candidate. How a ubiquitous virus that typically leads to benign 
latent infections can promote cancer and autoimmune disease in at-risk 
populations is not fully understood. Here we review the evidence that EBV is a 
causal agent for MS and how various risk factors may affect EBV infection and 
immune control. We focus on EBV contributing to MS through reprogramming of 
latently infected B lymphocytes and the chronic presentation of viral antigens 
as a potential source of autoreactivity through molecular mimicry. We consider 
how knowledge of EBV-associated cancers may be instructive for understanding the 
role of EBV in MS and discuss the potential for therapies that target EBV to 
treat MS.
