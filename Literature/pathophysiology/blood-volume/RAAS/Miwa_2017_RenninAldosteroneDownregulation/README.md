# Miwa & Fujita 2017: RAAS and ADH Down-regulation in ME/CFS

## Paper Summary

This study demonstrates paradoxical suppression of volume-regulatory hormones in ME/CFS patients despite documented hypovolemia. Normally, reduced blood volume triggers activation of the renin-aldosterone-aldosterone system (RAAS) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to retain fluid and restore blood volume. However, ME/CFS patients show the opposite pattern: both systems are down-regulated.

## Clinical Significance

**High**: This finding:
1. Helps explain why ME/CFS patients develop chronic hypovolemia
2. Suggests a central dysregulation rather than peripheral fluid loss
3. Identifies potential therapeutic target (ADH supplementation)
4. May define a distinct ME/CFS subgroup

## Study Quality

**Strengths:**
- Rigorous hormonal measurements
- Matched control group
- Objective cardiac measures via echocardiography
- Treatment trial with objective outcomes
- Statistical significance achieved (p<0.01)

**Limitations:**
- Small sample (n=14)
- Single-center study
- No mechanistic investigation
- Awaiting replication
