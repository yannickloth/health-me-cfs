# Key Findings: Miwa & Fujita 2017 - RAAS and ADH Down-regulation

## Main Findings

1. **Paradoxical RAAS suppression**: Plasma aldosterone 33% lower in ME/CFS (104 vs 157 pg/ml, p=0.004), despite hypovolemia that should trigger activation
2. **ADH system dysregulation**: Antidiuretic hormone 33% lower (2.2 vs 3.3 pg/ml, p=0.02), opposite of expected response to low blood volume
3. **Therapeutic response**: Desmopressin (ADH analog) improved orthostatic symptoms in 50% of patients
4. **Cardiac findings**: Reduced cardiac preload and output confirmed via echocardiography

## Clinical Implications

- **Hypovolemia mechanism**: Not due to excessive water loss, but to failure of volume-regulating systems
- **Treatment potential**: ADH supplementation (desmopressin) may help subset of patients with OI
- **Diagnostic marker**: Low aldosterone + low ADH pattern could identify ME/CFS subgroup
- **Subtype identification**: Responders to desmopressin may represent distinct subgroup

## Limitations

- **Small sample**: Only 14 patients, needs replication in larger cohort
- **Single study**: No independent confirmation yet
- **Mechanism unclear**: Why are RAAS/ADH down-regulated? Central dysregulation? Autoimmune?
- **Treatment subset**: Only 50% responded to desmopressin, predictor factors unknown

## Integration Points

### Chapter 6: Energy Metabolism & Blood Volume
- Core evidence for hypovolemia in ME/CFS (postdiction)
- Cite as **achievement** (peer-reviewed, significant p-values)
- Explain paradox: expected RAAS activation, found suppression

### Chapter 9: Endocrine Dysfunction
- Add to hormonal dysregulation section
- Link to HPA axis dysfunction (shared central regulation)
- Cite as **achievement** with limitations noted

### Chapter 14b: Treatment Protocols
- Add desmopressin trial to OI treatment options
- Note: 50% response rate, trial recommended for refractory OI
- Cite as **hypothesis** (preliminary evidence)

### Appendix H: Annotated Bibliography
- Add under "Cardiovascular and Blood Volume Regulation"
- Emphasize paradoxical nature of findings
