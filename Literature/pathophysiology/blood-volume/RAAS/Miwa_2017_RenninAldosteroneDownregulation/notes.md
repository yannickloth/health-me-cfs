# Down-regulation of renin-aldosterone and ADH systems in ME/CFS

**Authors:** Kunihisa Miwa, Masahiro Fujita
**Journal:** Journal of Cardiology, 2017, 69(4):684-688
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jjcc.2016.06.003
**PMID:** 27401397

## Key Points

- **Plasma aldosterone significantly lower in ME/CFS**: 104±37 pg/ml vs 157±67 pg/ml in controls (p=0.004)
- **ADH significantly lower**: 2.2±1.0 pg/ml vs 3.3±1.5 pg/ml in controls (p=0.02)
- **Paradoxical finding**: Both RAAS and ADH systems down-regulated despite reduced cardiac preload and output
- **Treatment response**: 50% of patients showed symptom improvement with desmopressin (ADH analog)

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Cross-sectional case-control study
**Sample Size:** 14 ME/CFS patients (9 females, mean age 36±11 years), 13 matched controls
**Diagnostic Criteria:** Canadian clinical diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS
**Measurements:**
- Transthoracic echocardiography
- 10-minute active standing test
- Plasma measurements: aldosterone, renin activity (PRA), ADH, norepinephrine

## Results Summary

**Hormonal Findings:**
- Lower aldosterone levels (33% reduction, p=0.004)
- Lower ADH levels (33% reduction, p=0.02)
- Findings consistent despite reduced cardiac preload

**Treatment Trial:**
- Desmopressin (ADH analog) administered to 10 patients
- 5/10 (50%) showed improvement in orthostatic intolerance symptoms
- Associated with increased urinary osmotic pressure and decreased heart rate

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

This paper provides critical evidence for hypovolemia mechanisms in ME/CFS:
1. **Paradoxical RAAS suppression**: Normally, hypovolemia activates RAAS; ME/CFS shows opposite pattern
2. **ADH dysregulation**: Similarly suppressed when should be elevated
3. **Therapeutic target**: Desmopressin shows promise for OI symptoms in subset of patients
4. **Integration point**: Chapter 8 (Endocrine Dysfunction), Chapter 6 (Cardiovascular/Blood Volume)

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** Medium-High (peer-reviewed, rigorous methodology)
- **Sample Size:** Small (n=14 patients, n=13 controls)
- **Replication:** Needs independent confirmation (single study)
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None declared

**Certainty Level:** Medium (solid methodology but small sample, awaiting replication)
