ABSTRACT:
This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examined viral infections as an etiological factor in ME/CFS. The analysis included 64 studies with a total of 4,971 ME/CFS patients and 9,221 control subjects, analyzing 18 species of viruses.

METHODS:
Systematic search of PubMed and Cochrane Library through December 31, 2022. Meta-analysis calculated odds ratios comparing viral infection prevalence in ME/CFS patients versus healthy and diseased controls.

KEY FINDINGS:

Five viruses showed odds ratios >2.0 (indicating moderate to strong associations):

DNA VIRUSES:
- Human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7): OR >2.0
- Parvovirus B19 (including co-infections): OR >2.0

RNA VIRUSES:
- Borna disease virus (BDV): OR ≥3.47 (STRONGEST ASSOCIATION - exceeded cutoff vs. both healthy and diseased controls, categorized as "moderate association")
- Enterovirus: OR >2.0
- Coxsackie B virus: OR >2.0

HETEROGENEITY:
- EBV (with healthy controls): >50% heterogeneity across studies
- Enterovirus (with diseased controls): >50% heterogeneity across studies
- High heterogeneity indicates variability in findings, suggesting possible subgroup effects or methodological differences

CONCLUSION:
The meta-analysis provides evidence for viral associations with ME/CFS, particularly strong for BDV (OR≥3.47), with moderate associations for HHV-7, parvovirus B19, enteroviruses, and coxsackie B viruses. However, heterogeneity in findings suggests that viral etiology may apply to specific subgroups rather than all ME/CFS patients.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Associations do not prove causation. Elevated viral markers could indicate:
1. Viral infection triggers ME/CFS onset
2. ME/CFS immune dysfunction allows viral reactivation
3. Both conditions share underlying immune susceptibility
