# Viral Etiology Meta-Analysis for ME/CFS

**Hwang et al., Journal of Translational Medicine 2023**

## Summary

Comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of viral associations in ME/CFS. Analyzed 64 studies with 4,971 ME/CFS patients and 9,221 controls, examining 18 viral species. Five viruses showed odds ratios >2.0: BDV (OR≥3.47, strongest), HHV-7, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and coxsackie B virus.

**Sample:** 64 studies, 4,971 ME/CFS patients, 9,221 controls

**Key Finding:** Multiple viral triggers associated with ME/CFS; BDV shows strongest association (OR≥3.47); high heterogeneity for EBV and enterovirus suggests subgroup effects.

## Certainty: MODERATE

**Strengths:**
- Largest meta-analysis on viral ME/CFS etiology
- Rigorous systematic review methods
- Large sample size across 64 studies
- Quantitative comparison of 18 viral species
- Distinguishes healthy vs. diseased controls

**Limitations:**
- Association does NOT prove causation
- High heterogeneity for EBV, enterovirus (>50%)
- BDV in humans controversial (requires validation)
- Methodological variability across studies
- Publication bias possible

## Validity Rating

**MODERATE CONFIDENCE** - Use `observation` for OR values and associations (replicated across 64 studies), `hypothesis` for causation direction and mechanisms (plausible but not proven), `open_question` for heterogeneity explanations.

**Required caveats:**
- ALWAYS note: Association, NOT causation
- ALWAYS note: Sample sizes (n=4,971 ME/CFS, n=9,221 controls, 64 studies)
- ALWAYS note: Heterogeneity for EBV and enterovirus (>50%)
- BDV caution: Strongest association but controversial; requires validation
- Subgroup interpretation: Viral etiology likely applies to subgroups, not all patients

## Viral OR Summary Table

| Virus | Odds Ratio | Type | Evidence Quality |

| HHV-7 | >2.0 | DNA herpesvirus | Moderate |
| Parvovirus B19 | >2.0 | DNA parvovirus | Moderate |
| Enterovirus | >2.0 | RNA enterovirus | Moderate (high heterogeneity) |
| Coxsackie B | >2.0 | RNA enterovirus | Moderate |
| EBV | Variable | DNA herpesvirus | Moderate (high heterogeneity) |
