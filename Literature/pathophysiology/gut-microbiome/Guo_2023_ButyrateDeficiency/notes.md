**PMID:** 36758522

**PMCID:** PMC10183837

## Key Points

- **Major finding:** ME/CFS patients show deficient butyrate-producing capacity in gut microbiome
- **Specific bacteria reduced:** Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectale
- **Functional confirmation:** Multiple methods (functional metagenomics, qPCR, metabolomics) confirmed reduced butyrate synthesis
- **Clinical correlation:** F. prausnitzii abundance inversely associated with fatigue severity (more bacteria = less fatigue)
- **Multi-site validation:** 106 ME/CFS patients and 91 healthy controls across multiple geographic locations

## Methodology

- **Study design:** Multi-omic cross-sectional analysis
- **Sample size:** n=106 ME/CFS patients, n=91 healthy controls
- **Methods:**
  - Shotgun metagenomic sequencing
  - Functional metagenomics
  - qPCR for bacterial quantification
  - Targeted metabolomics (SCFA quantification)
  - Machine learning classification
- **Sites:** Multiple geographic locations (multi-center study)
- **Controls:** Age and sex-matched healthy controls

## Main Findings

### Butyrate-Producing Bacteria

1. **Faecalibacterium prausnitzii:** Significantly reduced in ME/CFS
2. **Eubacterium rectale:** Significantly reduced in ME/CFS
3. Both are recognized as abundant butyrate producers in healthy gut microbiome

### Functional Dysbiosis

- Not just compositional changes, but functional alterations
- Deficient microbial capacity for butyrate synthesis confirmed by:
  - Functional gene analysis (metagenomics)
  - Direct bacterial quantification (qPCR)
  - Metabolite measurement (fecal SCFA levels)

### Clinical Associations

- **Fatigue severity:** Inverse correlation with F. prausnitzii abundance
- **Bacterial network disturbances:** Altered microbial interactions in ME/CFS
- **Machine learning:** Successfully classified disease status based on bacterial patterns

## Mechanistic Implications

### Butyrate Functions

- Primary energy source for colonocytes (intestinal epithelial cells)
- Provides up to 70% of energy needed by colon cells
- Maintains gut barrier integrity
- Anti-inflammatory properties via HDAC inhibition
- Immune modulation

### Potential Pathophysiology Links

- Reduced butyrate → impaired gut barrier function
- Increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut")
- Bacterial translocation and endotoxemia
- Systemic inflammation
- Immune dysregulation
- Altered energy metabolism

## Clinical Implications

- Gut microbiome alterations are functionally significant in ME/CFS
- Butyrate-producing bacteria may be therapeutic targets
- Dietary interventions to increase butyrate production (resistant starch, prebiotics)
- Probiotic supplementation with butyrate-producing strains
- Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) consideration
- Potential biomarker for disease classification

## Limitations

- Cross-sectional design (cannot establish causality)
- Geographic variations in microbiome composition
- Diet not fully controlled/standardized
- Unclear if dysbiosis is cause or consequence of ME/CFS
- No intervention/treatment trial component

## Integration Points

### Chapter 5: Disease Course and Natural History
- Microbiome dysbiosis as persistent feature of disease
- Potential biomarker for disease severity

### Chapter 6: Pathophysiological Mechanisms
- Gut dysbiosis and butyrate deficiency as mechanistic pathway
- Links to immune dysfunction, inflammation, energy metabolism

### Chapter 7: Energy Metabolism and Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- Butyrate as energy substrate for colonocytes
- Potential systemic metabolic effects

### Chapter 9: Immune and Inflammatory Mechanisms
- Butyrate's anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties
- Gut barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation

### Chapter 15: Dietary and Lifestyle Interventions
- Evidence-based rationale for butyrate-enhancing dietary strategies
- Resistant starch, prebiotics, fermented foods

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** HIGH (peer-reviewed, Cell Host & Microbe, multi-omic approach)
- **Sample Size:** Good (n=106 ME/CFS, n=91 controls)
- **Replication:** Confirmed by multiple methods within study; consistent with other ME/CFS microbiome studies
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Standard academic disclosures; NIH-funded
- **Limitations:** Cross-sectional design; causality not established

**Overall Certainty for Clinical Use:** MEDIUM-HIGH for mechanistic understanding; MEDIUM for therapeutic targets (requires intervention trials)
