# Mast Cell Disorders: Cerebral Blood Flow and Small Fiber Neuropathy (Novak et al., 2022)

## Citation
Novak P, Giannetti MP, Weller E, Hamilton MJ, Castells M. Mast cell disorders are associated with decreased cerebral blood flow and small fiber neuropathy. *Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology*. 2022 Mar;128(3):299-306.e1. doi:10.1016/j.anai.2021.10.006. PMID: 34648976.

## Summary
Demonstrates that 80% of mast cell disorder patients (both hereditary alpha tryptasemia and MCAS) have small fiber neuropathy, and all show reduced cerebral blood flow during orthostatic stress (~20-24% reduction). Universal dysautonomia was detected when combining autonomic test results.

## Relevance to ME/CFS
**CRITICAL PAPER** - Provides objective biomarkers for mast cell-mediated neurological dysfunction that directly parallel ME/CFS findings:
- Orthostatic intolerance with cerebral hypoperfusion (common in ME/CFS)
- Small fiber neuropathy (increasingly recognized in ME/CFS)
- Dysautonomia (widespread in ME/CFS)
- Pain + cognitive impairment + fatigue (cardinal ME/CFS symptoms)

Suggests that MCAS may underlie a subset of ME/CFS cases, and that mast cell testing should be considered in ME/CFS patients with severe orthostatic intolerance.

## Key Numbers
- **80-81%** small fiber neuropathy rate
- **-20 to -24%** cerebral blood flow reduction during tilt
- **100%** dysautonomia detection when tests combined
- **n=31** patients, **n=14** controls
