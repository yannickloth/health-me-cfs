**Journal:** Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 2022 Mar;128(3):299-306.e1

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.anai.2021.10.006

**PMID:** 34648976

## Key Points

- **80% of mast cell disorder patients have small fiber neuropathy** (both HαT and MCAS groups)
- **Orthostatic cerebral blood flow reduced ~20-24%** compared to controls (objective measurement via transcranial Doppler)
- **Universal dysautonomia** detected in all patients when combining sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sudomotor tests
- **Similar presentations despite different tryptase levels** (HαT: 14.3 ng/mL vs MCAS: 3.8 ng/mL) - suggests common final pathway

## Methodology

**Study Design:**
- Case-control study
- 15 HαT patients, 16 MCAS patients, 14 matched controls
- Patients recruited from Brigham and Women's Hospital (tertiary referral center)

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- HαT: Genetic testing for alpha-tryptase duplication
- MCAS: Clinical criteria (recurrent mast cell activation symptoms + response to mast cell mediator treatment)

**Assessments:**
- **Autonomic testing battery:**
  - Valsalva maneuver (baroreceptor function)
  - Deep breathing test (parasympathetic function)
  - Sudomotor test (sympathetic cholinergic function)
  - Tilt table test with continuous transcranial Doppler (cerebral blood flow velocity)
- **Small fiber neuropathy:**
  - Skin punch biopsies (3mm) from calf
  - Immunohistochemistry for PGP 9.5 (nerve fiber marker)
  - Quantification of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD)

**Statistical Analysis:**
- ANOVA for group comparisons
- Post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction
- P < 0.05 considered significant

## Results Summary

**Cerebral Blood Flow:**
- Controls: Minimal CBFv change during tilt (+2.3 ± 8.1%)
- HαT: Marked reduction during tilt (-24.2 ± 14.3%, P < 0.001)
- MCAS: Marked reduction during tilt (-20.8 ± 5.5%, P < 0.001)
- No significant difference between HαT and MCAS

**Small Fiber Neuropathy:**
- HαT: 80% (12/15) met diagnostic criteria for SFN
- MCAS: 81% (13/16) met diagnostic criteria for SFN
- Reduced IENFD compared to age-adjusted normative values
- Distal-predominant pattern (typical for SFN)

**Autonomic Function:**
- **All patients** showed abnormalities when tests combined
- Individual tests: Variable patterns
- Sympathetic dysfunction: More prominent
- Parasympathetic dysfunction: Present but less severe
- Sudomotor dysfunction: Common (sweating abnormalities)

**Clinical Symptoms:**
- Orthostatic intolerance: 100% of patients
- Pain: >90% (neuropathic characteristics)
- Cognitive impairment: >80% (brain fog, memory issues)
- Fatigue: >85%

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

**Direct ME/CFS Parallels:**
This study documents objective abnormalities in mast cell disorder patients that are **identical** to commonly reported ME/CFS findings:
1. Orthostatic intolerance with cerebral hypoperfusion (documented in ME/CFS)
2. Small fiber neuropathy (increasingly recognized in ME/CFS)
3. Dysautonomia (widespread in ME/CFS)
4. Cognitive impairment + fatigue + pain (cardinal ME/CFS symptoms)

**MCAS-ME/CFS Overlap:**
- Weinstock et al. (2025) documented mast cell activation in ME/CFS
- This study provides objective biomarkers for that activation (CBFv, IENFD)
- Suggests subset of ME/CFS patients may have undiagnosed MCAS

**Mechanistic Insights:**
1. **Cerebral hypoperfusion:** May explain cognitive dysfunction in ME/CFS
2. **Small fiber neuropathy:** May explain pain, dysautonomia, and sensory abnormalities
3. **Common final pathway:** Despite different initiating mechanisms (HαT vs MCAS), outcomes are similar - suggests ME/CFS may also reach common endpoint via multiple triggers

**Therapeutic Implications:**
- Mast cell stabilizers may improve cerebral perfusion
- Autonomic support (fluids, compression, medications) may be beneficial
- Treatment of SFN (if mast cell-mediated) could reduce pain and dysautonomia

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (rigorous objective measurements, standardized protocols, appropriate controls)
- **Sample Size:** Moderate (n=31 patients, n=14 controls) - adequate for case-control study with objective outcomes
- **Replication:** Builds on previous literature showing autonomic dysfunction in MCAS; first to combine CBFv with SFN measurements
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None declared
- **Limitations:**
  - Tertiary referral center (selection bias - severe cases)
  - Cross-sectional design (cannot establish causality: does MCAS cause SFN, or vice versa?)
  - No ME/CFS cohort directly studied (overlap inferred)
  - Small sample for subgroup analyses

## Clinical Relevance Score: HIGH

This paper is **critical** for ME/CFS documentation because:
1. **Objective biomarkers** (not just subjective symptoms)
2. **High prevalence** (80% SFN rate)
3. **Direct symptom overlap** with ME/CFS (orthostatic intolerance, pain, cognitive issues)
4. **Testable hypotheses** (can screen ME/CFS patients for MCAS, SFN)
5. **Treatment targets** (mast cell stabilization, autonomic support)
