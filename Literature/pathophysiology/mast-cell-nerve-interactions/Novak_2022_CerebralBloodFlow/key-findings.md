# Key Findings: Mast Cell Disorders and Neurological Dysfunction

## Main Findings

1. **Small fiber neuropathy highly prevalent (80%):** Documented via skin biopsies in both HαT and MCAS patients, with reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density

2. **Cerebral hypoperfusion during orthostatic stress:** CBFv reduced ~20-24% compared to controls (objective transcranial Doppler measurements)

3. **Universal dysautonomia:** All patients showed autonomic dysfunction when sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sudomotor tests combined

4. **Similar outcomes despite different mechanisms:** HαT (genetic) and MCAS (acquired) showed nearly identical neurological findings, suggesting common final pathway

## Clinical Implications

- **Screening recommendation:** ME/CFS patients with orthostatic intolerance should be evaluated for MCAS
- **Objective biomarkers available:** Tilt table with CBFv, skin biopsy for SFN, autonomic testing battery
- **Treatment targets:** Mast cell stabilizers may improve cerebral perfusion and reduce SFN progression
- **Subtype identification:** Mast cell-mediated ME/CFS may be a distinct, treatable subset

## Limitations

- **Selection bias:** Tertiary referral center (severe cases)
- **Cross-sectional design:** Cannot determine causality (MCAS → SFN, or SFN → MCAS compensation?)
- **No direct ME/CFS cohort:** ME/CFS-MCAS overlap inferred from symptom similarity
- **Small sample:** n=31 patients - adequate but limited subgroup analysis power
