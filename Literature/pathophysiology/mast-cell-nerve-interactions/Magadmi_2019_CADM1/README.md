## Summary
Demonstrates that CADM1 protein mediates physical adhesion between mast cells and sensory neurons, and that this adhesion amplifies mast cell degranulation and IL-6 secretion in response to antigen stimulation. The effect is neuron-specific, suggesting that neurons provide additional signaling factors beyond simple adhesion.

## Relevance to ME/CFS
Provides mechanistic evidence for the "signal amplifier hypothesis" of mast cell dysfunction in ME/CFS. Physical contact between mast cells and sensory nerves could explain:
- Pain amplification disproportionate to tissue damage
- Small fiber neuropathy (observed in 80% of MCAS patients)
- Neurogenic inflammation
- Localized inflammatory microenvironments at nerve endings

## Key Mechanism
```
CADM1 adhesion → Enhanced mast cell responsiveness → Amplified IL-6 + degranulation → Neurogenic inflammation
```
