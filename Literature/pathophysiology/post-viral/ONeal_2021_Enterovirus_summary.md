# The Enterovirus Theory of Disease Etiology in ME/CFS

**Citation:** O'Neal AJ, Hanson MR. The Enterovirus Theory of Disease Etiology in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Critical Review. *Front Med.* 2021;8:688486. doi:10.3389/fmed.2021.688486

**PMID:** 34222292

## Key Findings

- Historical ME/CFS epidemics (1930s-1960s) coincided with polio outbreaks, suggesting enteroviral causation
- Increased prevalence of chronic/persistent enteroviral infections in ME/CFS cohorts vs. controls
- Enteroviruses can establish chronic CNS infections in hypothalamus, brainstem, cortex
- All brain/CSF tissue studies found enteroviral RNA or VP1 capsid protein; blood studies inconsistent
- Certain coxsackievirus strains downregulate mitochondrial energy metabolism proteins

## Mechanism

**Persistent Infection Models:**
1. Carrier-state: high virus levels in limited cells
2. Steady-state: low replication across many cells

**Tissue Tropism:**
- CNS (neurotropic strains)
- Muscle (myotropic strains)
- Both sites relevant to ME/CFS symptoms

**Metabolic Impact:**
- Viral proteins disrupt mitochondrial function
- Explains energy depletion and fatigue

## Methodological Critique

**Prior Studies Limited By:**
- Serology: non-specific (enterovirus antibodies common)
- RT-PCR: primers detect only 21-85 of 117 enterovirus species
- Blood sampling: misses CNS/muscle reservoirs
- Culture: cannot detect non-cytopathic variants

**Recommendation:** Use brain tissue, CSF, muscle biopsies with comprehensive RT-PCR or RNAseq

## Clinical Implications

- Post-viral onset explained for subset
- Links to mitochondrial dysfunction (complements WASF3 mechanism)
- Suggests antiviral strategies may help some patients
- Emphasizes need for tissue-specific testing

## Integration Points

**Chapter: Post-Viral Pathophysiology**
- Historical evidence for viral triggers
- Complement EBV, herpesvirus sections
- Use `observation` for epidemic patterns
- Use `hypothesis` for persistent infection mechanism

**Chapter: Mitochondrial Dysfunction**
- Enteroviral disruption of energy metabolism
- Cross-reference with Syed 2025 mitochondrial review
- Use `hypothesis` environment

**Certainty:** Medium (historical/epidemiological evidence strong; mechanistic proof limited by methodological challenges; requires definitive tissue studies)
