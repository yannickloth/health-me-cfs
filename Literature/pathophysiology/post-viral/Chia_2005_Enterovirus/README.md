# Chia (2005) - Enterovirus in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

## Summary

Review article presenting evidence for chronic enteroviral infection in ~48% of CFS patients, suggesting post-viral etiology in subset.

## Citation

Chia JKS. The role of enterovirus in chronic fatigue syndrome. *J Clin Pathol*. 2005;58(11):1126-1132. doi:10.1136/jcp.2004.020255

## Key Finding

**48% of CFS patients** had enteroviral RNA in stomach biopsies vs **8% of controls** (p<0.001)

## Why This Matters

1. **Identifies infectious subset** - ~half of patients may have chronic viral infection
2. **Mechanism:** dsRNA persistence, not acute infection
3. **Therapeutic target:** Subset may respond to antivirals
4. **Heterogeneity evidence:** 52% negative suggests multiple etiologies
5. **Modern relevance:** Parallels Long COVID viral persistence

## Type

## Certainty Assessment

### Prevalence data (48% vs 8%): MODERATE
- Multiple studies, multiple methods
- BUT: Some replication failures, RT-PCR specificity concerns

### Causation (enterovirus CAUSES CFS): LOW-MODERATE
- Association clear, causation uncertain
- Use `hypothesis` not `observation` for causal claims

### Treatment (interferon): LOW
- Small open-label trials only
- Use `hypothesis` or `speculation`

## Critical Notes

- **Author has conflicts:** Runs antiviral treatment clinic
- **Not all replicated:** Some negative studies exist
- **8% controls positive:** Unclear significance
- **Review, not original research:** Synthesizes others' work

## Modern Context (2026)

Highly relevant to:
- Long COVID viral persistence
- Post-viral ME/CFS phenotype
- EBV reactivation studies
- Need for viral biomarker stratification
