# Epstein-Barr Virus and the Origin of ME/CFS

**Citation:** Ruiz-Pablos M, Paiva B, Montero-Mateo R, Garcia N, Zabaleta A. Epstein-Barr Virus and the Origin of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. *Front Immunol.* 2021;12:656797. doi:10.3389/fimmu.2021.656797

**PMID:** 34867935

## Key Findings

- EBV latency and immune evasion may trigger ME/CFS in genetically predisposed individuals
- Specific HLA-II alleles (DRB1, DQB1 variants) confer greater EBV susceptibility
- ME/CFS patients show elevated anti-EBV antibodies, defective EBV-specific immune responses, increased viral reactivation
- ~10% of infectious mononucleosis patients develop ME/CFS at 6 months

## Mechanism

1. EBV establishes latency in B cells
2. In genetically susceptible individuals, cells evade immune surveillance
3. Persistent latent infection or periodic reactivation triggers immune dysregulation
4. Chronic immune activation leads to ME/CFS symptoms

## Clinical Implications

- Post-viral onset pattern explained for subset of patients
- Suggests anti-EBV therapies (antivirals, immunotherapy) for selected patients
- Genetic screening (HLA alleles) may identify at-risk individuals

## Integration Points

**Chapter: Post-Viral Pathophysiology**
- Primary citation for EBV mechanism
- Use `observation` environment for clinical associations
- Use `hypothesis` for immune evasion mechanism

**Chapter: Genetic Susceptibility**
- HLA allele associations
- Cite as `observation` with note about replication needed

**Certainty:** Medium (clinical associations established; mechanism plausible but incompletely proven; therapeutic trials show mixed results)
