This review compares two post-infectious conditions affecting millions globally: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID. Some patients remain unwell for months after recovering from acute COVID-19, developing persistent fatigue, cognitive issues, headaches, and other debilitating symptoms. The review examines how both conditions share similar underlying biological abnormalities across multiple organ systems.

Between 13-45% of individuals with persistent, debilitating Long COVID symptoms meet the National Academy of Medicine case definition criteria for ME/CFS.

Both conditions demonstrate shared pathophysiological features including:
- Central and autonomic nervous system abnormalities: Reduced cerebral blood flow, cognitive deficits, autonomic dysfunction
- Immune response abnormalities: Abnormal cytokine production, autoantibodies, natural killer cell dysfunction
- Energy metabolism impairment: Impaired ATP generation, mitochondrial dysfunction
- Redox imbalance: Increased oxidative stress, decreased antioxidants
- Cardiovascular dysfunction: Reduced exercise capacity, endothelial dysfunction, reduced blood volume
- Infectious agent reactivation: Reactivation of latent herpesviruses
- Microbiome alterations: Dysbiosis and proinflammatory changes
