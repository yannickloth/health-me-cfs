# Herpesvirus Infection of Endothelial Cells in ME/CFS

**Citation:** Nunes JM, Kell DB, Pretorius E. Herpesvirus Infection of Endothelial Cells as a Systemic Pathological Axis in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. *Viruses.* 2024;16(4):572. doi:10.3390/v16040572

**PMID:** 38675914

## Key Findings

- Novel hypothesis: latent herpesvirus infection of endothelial cells (ECs) may explain ME/CFS persistence
- EBV latent proteins (EBNA-1, LMP-1) induce proinflammatory EC phenotype
- HHV-6 U94 protein reduces EC migration and angiogenic capacity
- Systemic consequences: impaired tissue perfusion, reduced cerebral blood flow, microclot formation

## Mechanisms of Vascular Dysfunction

**EBV Effects:**
- LMP-1 → NF-κB activation → IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, adhesion molecules
- Inhibition of apoptosis → persistent dysfunctional endothelium

**HHV-6 Effects:**
- Low-level replication in EC reservoirs
- Reduced migration/angiogenesis
- Associated with cerebral hypoperfusion

**Systemic Outcomes:**
- Blood-brain barrier compromise
- Microcirculatory defects
- Increased coagulation propensity
- Impaired organ perfusion

## Clinical Implications

- Explains multisystem symptoms (brain fog, orthostatic intolerance, exercise intolerance)
- Links vascular dysfunction to immune/viral pathology
- Suggests anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral combination therapies
- May explain similarities between ME/CFS and long COVID (endothelial involvement in both)

## Integration Points

**Chapter: Vascular Dysfunction**
- Primary citation for endothelial hypothesis
- Use `hypothesis` environment (novel 2024 proposal)

**Chapter: Post-Viral Pathophysiology**
- Complements EBV, HHV-6 mechanisms
- Cross-reference with blood flow/perfusion studies
- Use `hypothesis` environment

**Chapter: Cognitive Dysfunction**
- Reduced cerebral blood flow mechanism
- Use `hypothesis` linking endothelial dysfunction to "brain fog"

**Chapter: Long COVID Connections**
- Shared endothelial pathology
- Use `observation` for parallels

**Certainty:** Medium-Low (novel hypothesis with plausible mechanisms but limited direct evidence; requires validation with endothelial cell sampling/imaging studies)
