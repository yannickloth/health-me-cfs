## Key Findings

- IDO-2 expressed and active in PBMCs from long COVID patients months/years after infection
- IDO-2 also detected in brain tissue long after SARS-CoV-2 infection
- Paralleled by autophagy, reduced mitochondrial function, depleted amino acids and Krebs cycle metabolites
- Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) drives IDO-2 expression; kynurenine activates AHR (self-perpetuating cycle)
- AHR antagonist halts IDO-2 expression and autophagy *ex vivo*

## Mechanism

1. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers IDO-2 expression
2. IDO-2 degrades tryptophan → kynurenine pathway metabolites (quinolinic acid, 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid)
3. Kynurenine activates AHR
4. AHR drives more IDO-2 expression (positive feedback loop)
5. Toxic metabolites accumulate in lungs, heart, brain
6. Autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, energy depletion

## Connection to ME/CFS

- Authors note: "symptoms of PASC are related to symptoms of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome"
- Recent studies found elevated kynurenine metabolites in ME/CFS
- Suggests overlapping tryptophan-kynurenine pathway dysregulation
- Both conditions show mitochondrial dysfunction, fatigue, PEM

## Therapeutic Implications

- No human IDO-2 inhibitors currently exist
- AHR antagonists suppress IDO-2 and autophagy
- Potential intervention target for long COVID and possibly ME/CFS subset

## Integration Points

**Chapter: Long COVID and ME/CFS**
- Primary citation for IDO-2/kynurenine pathway
- Use `observation` for long COVID findings
- Use `hypothesis` for ME/CFS connection (suggestive but not directly tested)

**Chapter: Metabolic Dysfunction**
- Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway dysregulation
- Links to mitochondrial impairment
- Use `observation` for pathway activation

**Chapter: Treatment Strategies**
- AHR antagonists as speculative intervention
- Use `speculation` environment (ex vivo only, no human trials)

**Certainty:** High for long COVID; Medium for ME/CFS connection (mechanistic overlap plausible, direct evidence limited)
