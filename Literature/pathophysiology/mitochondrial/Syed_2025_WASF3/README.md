## Summary

This comprehensive review from NIH researchers examines mitochondrial dysfunction as a core pathogenic mechanism in ME/CFS, with emphasis on recent discoveries linking endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to elevated WASF3 protein. WASF3 disrupts mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly (complexes III and IV), leading to impaired ATP production and metabolic shift toward glycolysis.

**Key Discovery:** Elevated WASF3 in patient cells and muscle biopsies; transgenic mice overexpressing WASF3 recapitulate ME/CFS exercise phenotype (reduced capacity, elevated lactate).

**Therapeutic Implications:** ER stress inhibition (salubrinal) restored mitochondrial function in patient cells. RCT evidence supports CoQ10, NADH, and D-ribose supplementation.

## Clinical Significance

- **Mechanistic pathway:** ER stress → WASF3 ↑ → Complex III/IV disruption → ATP ↓ → PEM
- **Biomarker potential:** WASF3, ER stress markers, CIV subunits
- **Treatment targets:** ER stress inhibitors (experimental), mitochondrial cofactors (available)
- **PEM explanation:** ATP depletion and slow regeneration explain symptom exacerbation after exertion
- **Long COVID link:** Shared mitochondrial pathology noted

## Key Mechanisms

**WASF3 Pathology:**
- Disrupts respiratory supercomplex assembly
- Destabilizes cytochrome c oxidase (CIV) subunits
- Promotes actin polymerization → glycolytic shift
- Inhibits oxidative phosphorylation

**Metabolic Consequences:**
- Reduced ATP synthesis (P-31 MRS documented)
- Increased intracellular acidosis
- Decreased oxygen utilization
- Elevated lactate during exercise

## Therapeutic Evidence

**RCT-Supported:**
- CoQ10 + NADH: Improved fatigue, cognition, sleep, autonomic function
- D-ribose: Enhanced energy, mental clarity
- KPAX002: >50% improvement in fatigue/concentration

**Experimental:**
- Salubrinal (ER stress inhibitor): Restored mitochondrial function in patient cells
- Sodium dichloroacetate: Reduced fatigue severity

## Limitations

- Review article (synthesizes existing research)
- WASF3 mechanism recently discovered - needs independent replication
- Causality unclear (primary vs. secondary dysfunction)
- Animal model uses induced pathology
- Some therapeutic trials small-scale
