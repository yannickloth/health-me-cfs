**Journal:** Physiology (Bethesda), 2025, 40(4)
**DOI:** 10.1152/physiol.00056.2024

## Key Points

- Comprehensive review of mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS
- Identifies WASF3 protein as critical mediator of mitochondrial impairment
- Links ER stress to disrupted respiratory complex assembly
- Reviews evidence from cellular studies, patient biopsies, and animal models
- Discusses therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondrial function

## Methodology

**Review Type:** Comprehensive literature review with focus on recent mechanistic discoveries
**Evidence Sources:**
- Phosphorus-31 MRS studies (ATP synthesis)
- Patient fibroblast cell lines
- Skeletal muscle biopsies
- Transgenic mouse models
- Clinical trials of mitochondrial-targeted therapies

## Results Summary

### Mitochondrial Dysfunction Evidence

**ATP Production Impairment:**
- P-31 MRS: Lower ATP synthesis rates in ME/CFS patients
- Increased intracellular acidosis (glycolytic metabolism shift)
- Decreased oxygen utilization during exercise (independent of deconditioning)

**WASF3-ER Stress Mechanism:**
- Elevated WASF3 protein in patient fibroblasts (lifelong fatigue case)
- Increased endoplasmic reticulum stress markers
- Reduced respiratory complex IV (CIV) subunit abundance
- Pharmacological ER stress relief decreased WASF3 and restored respiration

**Molecular Mechanism:**
- WASF3 disrupts assembly of respiratory complexes III and IV
- Destabilizes CIV subunits specifically
- Interferes with supercomplex formation
- Promotes actin polymerization, driving glycolysis

### Clinical Validation

**Human Muscle Biopsies:**
- Elevated WASF3 protein vs. controls
- Increased ER stress markers
- Decreased CIV levels
- Consistent pattern across ME/CFS cohorts

**Animal Model:**
- Transgenic mice with human WASF3 overexpression
- Significantly reduced exercise capacity
- Higher blood lactate (impaired oxidative metabolism)
- Recapitulates ME/CFS exercise phenotype

### Oxidative Stress & Redox Imbalance

- Elevated lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls
- Oxidized DNA bases
- Reduced CoQ10 levels (electron transport chain cofactor)
- Possible peroxisomal dysfunction

### Connection to PEM

Mitochondrial dysfunction explains post-exertional malaise:
- Rapid ATP depletion after exertion
- Slow ATP regeneration
- Impaired fuel substrate oxidation
- Increased muscle oxidative stress
- Delayed fatigue recovery

### Therapeutic Approaches (Table 1 in article)

**Cofactor Supplementation:**
- CoQ10 and NADH: Improved fatigue, cognition, sleep, autonomic function (RCTs)
- D-ribose: Enhanced energy, mental clarity, well-being

**Metabolic Modulators:**
- Sodium dichloroacetate (DCA): Reduced fatigue by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase
- KPAX002 (methylphenidate + mitochondrial nutrients): >50% improvement in RCTs

**Emerging Targets:**
- ER stress inhibitors (salubrinal): Reduced WASF3, restored mitochondrial function in patient cells

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

**Mechanistic Clarity:**
Provides molecular pathway from ER stress → WASF3 elevation → respiratory complex disruption → ATP deficit → exercise intolerance and PEM.

**Biomarker Potential:**
- WASF3 levels may serve as diagnostic marker
- ER stress markers could guide treatment selection
- CIV subunit levels measurable in muscle biopsies

**Treatment Implications:**
- Multiple therapeutic targets identified (ER stress, WASF3, CoQ10, etc.)
- Evidence-based supplement recommendations
- Mechanistic rationale for existing empiric treatments

**Long COVID Connection:**
Notes emerging evidence of shared mitochondrial pathology between ME/CFS and Long COVID.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (comprehensive review, NIH authors, peer-reviewed in high-quality physiology journal)
- **Sample:** Review synthesizing multiple studies with varied sample sizes
- **Replication:** WASF3 findings replicated across patient cells, biopsies, and animal models
- **Conflicts of Interest:** NIH-funded, unlikely conflicts
- **Limitations:** Review nature (not primary research); WASF3 mechanism recently discovered, needs further validation; uncertainty whether mitochondrial dysfunction is primary or secondary pathology
