## Key Points

- **Comprehensive 2025 review** synthesizing evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction as central ME/CFS pathophysiology
- **Energy production impairment:** Lower ATP synthesis rates, increased glycolysis, intracellular acidosis
- **Oxidative stress:** Elevated lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls, oxidized DNA; reduced antioxidants (CoQ10)
- **WASF3-ER stress axis:** Novel mechanism linking viral infections → ER stress → mitochondrial dysfunction → PEM
- **Long COVID parallels:** Similar mitochondrial impairment, suggesting shared pathophysiology
- **Therapeutic targets:** CoQ10, NADH, ER stress modulators (salubrinal), metabolic enhancers

## Results Summary

### Energy Metabolism Impairment

**ATP Depletion:**
- Lower mitochondrial metabolism and ATP synthesis rate in skeletal muscle
- Rapid ATP depletion during exertion
- Slow regeneration post-exercise → explains delayed PEM recovery

**Metabolic Shift:**
- Increased intracellular acidosis (elevated lactate)
- More glycolytic activity (anaerobic metabolism)
- Reduced aerobic capacity
- Explains exercise intolerance and 2-day CPET findings

### Oxidative Stress and Redox Imbalance

**Damage Markers Elevated:**
- Lipid peroxidation products
- Protein carbonyls
- Oxidized DNA bases

**Antioxidants Depleted:**
- Coenzyme Q10 reduced
- Imbalance damages cellular components
- Impairs mitochondrial respiration

### WASF3-ER Stress Mechanism (Novel)

**Discovery:**
- WASF3 protein elevated in ME/CFS patient fibroblasts and muscle biopsies
- ER stress markers elevated alongside WASF3
- Reduced respiratory complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) subunit levels

**Mechanism:**
1. Viral infection or other stressor triggers ER stress
2. ER stress induces WASF3 expression
3. WASF3 localizes to mitochondria (via ER-mitochondria contact sites - MAMs)
4. WASF3 interacts with Complex III (cytochrome bc1)
5. Destabilizes Complex IV subunits
6. Disrupts respiratory supercomplex assembly
7. Decreased oxygen consumption and ATP production
8. Promotes actin polymerization → drives glycolysis

**Evidence:**
- Transgenic mice overexpressing WASF3: significantly reduced exercise capacity, higher blood lactate
- Pharmacological alleviation of ER stress (salubrinal): restored mitochondrial function in patient cells
- Patient fibroblasts: elevated WASF3 + ER stress + reduced Complex IV

**Clinical Significance:**
- Provides mechanistic link: viral infection → cellular stress → energy depletion
- Explains post-viral onset pattern in many ME/CFS cases
- Offers therapeutic target (ER stress modulation)

### Multisystem Effects

**Brain/Neuronal:**
- Reduced neuronal energy for action potentials
- Impaired neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling
- Contributes to cognitive dysfunction ("brain fog")

**Immune System:**
- Altered T cell metabolism
- Chronic inflammation
- Immune dysregulation

**Autonomic Dysfunction:**
- Impaired calcium homeostasis at ER-mitochondria contact sites
- Affects cardiovascular regulation
- May explain POTS-like symptoms

### Long COVID Parallels

**Shared Features:**
- Increased glycolytic muscle fibers
- Impaired mitochondrial function
- Worsening with PEM
- Suggests shared pathophysiology between ME/CFS and long COVID

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

**Critical for:**
1. **Chapter: Pathophysiology** - Central mechanism explaining energy depletion and PEM
2. **Chapter: Post-Exertional Malaise** - ATP depletion mechanism explains delayed recovery
3. **Chapter: Post-Viral Onset** - WASF3-ER stress links viral triggers to chronic dysfunction
4. **Chapter: Treatment Strategies** - Identifies therapeutic targets (ER stress, mitochondria, antioxidants)
5. **Chapter: Long COVID Connections** - Comparative pathophysiology

**Key Clinical Implications:**
- Explains cardinal symptom (PEM) via energy metabolism
- Provides biological mechanism for post-viral onset pattern
- Identifies targetable pathways for intervention
- Validates exercise intolerance as physiological, not deconditioning
- Supports energy conservation/pacing strategies

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (comprehensive review in peer-reviewed physiology journal, 2025)
- **Evidence Base:** Multiple independent studies support each mechanism
- **WASF3 Mechanism:** Replicated in patient cells, mouse models, and tissue biopsies
- **Replication:** Core findings (ATP depletion, oxidative stress) replicated across multiple research groups
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None apparent
- **Limitations:**
  - Narrative review (not systematic meta-analysis)
  - WASF3 mechanism relatively new (2023), requires further validation
  - Therapeutic interventions show only modest efficacy (mechanism valid but treatment incomplete)
  - Patient heterogeneity - not all patients may have same mitochondrial defects

**Overall Assessment:** High certainty for core mitochondrial dysfunction; medium-high certainty for WASF3-ER stress mechanism (novel but well-supported); medium certainty for therapeutic efficacy.
