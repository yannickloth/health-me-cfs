# WASF3 Disrupts Mitochondrial Respiration in ME/CFS

**Wang et al., PNAS 2023**

## Summary

This landmark 2023 study identifies WASF3 protein as a specific molecular mediator of mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS. ER stress induces WASF3, which disrupts respiratory supercomplex assembly, causing impaired oxygen consumption and exercise intolerance.

**Sample:** n=14 ME/CFS patients, n=10 healthy controls (muscle biopsies)

**Key Finding:** Elevated WASF3 in ME/CFS patient muscle; shRNA knockdown restores respiratory capacity; transgenic mice with elevated WASF3 show exercise intolerance and elevated lactate matching human phenotype.

## Certainty: MODERATE-HIGH

**Strengths:**
- High-quality study (PNAS)
- Multi-level validation (human biopsies, cell culture rescue, transgenic mice)
- Mechanistically rigorous
- Clear therapeutic target identified

**Limitations:**
- Small sample (n=14 patients)
- Too recent for independent replication (2023)
- Unknown if WASF3 elevation applies to all ME/CFS patients or subset
- No therapeutic compounds available

## Validity Rating

**MODERATE-HIGH CONFIDENCE** - Use `observation` for empirical findings (elevated WASF3 in biopsies), `hypothesis` for WASF3 as mediator (well-validated but recent, awaiting replication), `speculation` for therapeutics (no compounds available).

**Required caveats:**
- ALWAYS note sample size (n=14)
- ALWAYS note "in subset of patients" (unknown prevalence)
- ALWAYS note "awaiting independent replication" (too recent)
