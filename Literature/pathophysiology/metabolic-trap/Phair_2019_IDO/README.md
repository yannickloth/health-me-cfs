# The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for ME/CFS

**Phair, Davis, Kashi - Diagnostics 2019**

## Summary

Theoretical mathematical model proposing that ME/CFS arises from bistability in tryptophan metabolism. IDO2 loss-of-function mutations combined with IDO1 substrate inhibition create a "metabolic trap" with two stable states. Once tryptophan exceeds a critical threshold, the system inevitably transitions to a pathological steady-state and cannot spontaneously return to normal.

**Sample:** Severely Ill Big Data Study cohort (genetic analysis)

**Key Claim:** All ME/CFS patients in study had ≥1 damaging IDO2 mutation; model predicts elevated tryptophan and reduced kynurenine in trapped state.

## Certainty: LOW-MODERATE

**Strengths:**
- Rigorous mathematical modeling
- Testable predictions
- Provides systems biology framework
- Published in peer-reviewed journal

**Limitations:**
- **IDO2 mutations NOT replicated in other ME/CFS cohorts**
- **Metabolomics findings inconsistent across studies**
- **CONTRADICTS Guo 2023 long COVID findings (opposite IDO2 mechanism)**
- **No therapeutic trials**
- Model-based, not empirical mechanistic validation

## CRITICAL: Contradiction with Guo 2023

**Phair 2019:** IDO2 loss-of-function → HIGH tryptophan, LOW kynurenine
**Guo 2023:** IDO2 gain-of-function → LOW tryptophan, HIGH kynurenine

These are **OPPOSITE mechanisms**. Integration must acknowledge this explicitly.

## Integration Status

- [x] Downloaded and organized in Literature folder
- [x] BibTeX entry created (to be added to references.bib)
- [ ] Added to Appendix H bibliography
- [ ] Integrated into Chapter 3 (Pathophysiology) with caveats
- [ ] Cross-referenced with Guo 2023 (contradiction noted)
- [ ] Marked as speculative for therapeutics

## Validity Rating

**LOW-MODERATE CONFIDENCE** - Use `hypothesis` for metabolic trap model (theoretical, not validated), `speculation` for therapeutics (no trials), `open_question` for which patients fit this mechanism.

**Required caveats:**
- ALWAYS note: Theoretical model, not empirical data
- ALWAYS note: IDO2 mutation ubiquity NOT replicated elsewhere
- ALWAYS distinguish: Phair 2019 (loss-of-function) vs. Guo 2023 (gain-of-function)
- NEVER state as established fact
- Use for subset hypothesis, not general mechanism
