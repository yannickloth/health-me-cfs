The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a cortical brain region that regulates various 
cognitive functions. One distinctive feature of the PFC is its protracted 
adolescent maturation, which is necessary for acquiring mature cognitive 
abilities in adulthood. Here, we show that microglia, the brain's resident 
immune cells, contribute to this maturational process. We find that transient 
and cell-specific deficiency of prefrontal microglia in adolescence is 
sufficient to induce an adult emergence of PFC-associated impairments in 
cognitive functions, dendritic complexity, and synaptic structures. While 
prefrontal microglia deficiency in adolescence also altered the 
excitatory-inhibitory balance in adult prefrontal circuits, there were no 
cognitive sequelae when prefrontal microglia were depleted in adulthood. Thus, 
our findings identify adolescence as a sensitive period for prefrontal microglia 
to act on cognitive development.
