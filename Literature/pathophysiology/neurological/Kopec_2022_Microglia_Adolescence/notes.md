**PMCID:** PMC8890703

## Key Points

- **Adolescence is a critical period:** Transient microglial deficiency specifically during adolescence induces adult cognitive impairments in PFC-associated functions
- **Timing-specificity:** Microglial depletion in adulthood produces NO cognitive sequelae, demonstrating a developmental window
- **Persistent effects:** Adolescent microglial deficiency causes long-term changes in dendritic complexity, synaptic structures, and excitatory-inhibitory balance
- **Irreversibility:** Once the adolescent window closes, the damage cannot be reversed

## Methodology

**Study Design:** Experimental mouse model with temporally-controlled microglial depletion

**Sample:** Multiple experimental groups with microglial depletion at different developmental stages

**Methods:**
- Cell-specific depletion of prefrontal microglia during adolescence vs. adulthood
- Adult cognitive testing (PFC-associated functions)
- Dendritic complexity analysis
- Synaptic structure analysis
- Excitatory-inhibitory balance measurements

**Temporal specificity:**
- Adolescent depletion group: Microglia depleted during adolescent period
- Adult depletion group: Microglia depleted in adulthood
- Control groups

## Acronym Definitions

**PFC:** Prefrontal cortex
**CNS:** Central nervous system
**E/I balance:** Excitatory-inhibitory balance

## Main Findings

1. **Critical period identified:** Adolescence is a sensitive period for prefrontal microglia function, distinct from other developmental stages

2. **Cognitive impairments:** Adult emergence of PFC-associated cognitive impairments following adolescent (but not adult) microglial deficiency

3. **Structural changes:** Reduced dendritic complexity and altered synaptic structures in adults following adolescent microglial loss

4. **Circuit dysfunction:** Altered excitatory-inhibitory balance in adult prefrontal circuits after adolescent microglial depletion

5. **Window closure:** No cognitive sequelae when microglia depleted in adulthood, confirming developmental window

## Clinical Implications for ME/CFS

1. **Developmental window hypothesis:** Supports the concept that adolescence represents a critical period where neurological insults can have lasting consequences

2. **Pediatric recovery potential:** Suggests intervention during the adolescent window might prevent permanent changes (intervention BEFORE window closes)

3. **Age-dependent outcomes:** May explain why pediatric ME/CFS patients show better recovery rates than adult-onset patients

4. **Therapeutic timing:** Emphasizes importance of early intervention during developmental windows

## Limitations

1. **Mouse model:** Findings in mice may not fully translate to humans
2. **Microglial depletion:** Study uses artificial depletion, not pathological activation (as in ME/CFS)
3. **No direct ME/CFS connection:** Study does not examine ME/CFS patients
4. **Mechanism differences:** Chronic immune activation (ME/CFS) vs. depletion (study) may have different effects

## Integration with ME/CFS Hypotheses

**Glial Maturation Window Hypothesis:**
- **Direct support:** Establishes adolescence as critical period for microglial function
- **Mechanism:** Microglia shape prefrontal circuit maturation during adolescence
- **Prediction:** Early intervention during adolescent window in ME/CFS could prevent permanent neurological changes

**Connection to pediatric recovery:**
- Adolescents with ME/CFS may retain plasticity if treated DURING the developmental window
- Once adolescence ends, the window closes and changes become permanent
- Explains higher recovery rates in pediatric vs. adult ME/CFS

**Testable predictions:**
- ME/CFS patients with adolescent onset should show PFC-related cognitive symptoms
- Neuroinflammation during adolescence (e.g., from viral infection) could disrupt microglial function
- Early anti-inflammatory interventions during adolescence might prevent chronic ME/CFS

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (Science Advances, rigorous experimental design)
- **Sample Size:** Adequate (multiple experimental groups)
- **Replication:** Single study, but aligns with broader critical period literature
- **Conflicts of Interest:** No conflicts declared
- **ME/CFS Applicability:** Medium (indirect evidence via developmental neurobiology)

**Overall Certainty for ME/CFS Integration:** Medium-High (0.75)
- High-quality evidence for critical period concept
- Indirect application to ME/CFS (requires mechanistic bridge)
- Strong biological plausibility
- Needs direct ME/CFS validation
