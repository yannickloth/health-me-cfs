**Journal:** Autoimmunity Reviews, 2024, Volume 23(10), Article 103606
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.autrev.2024.103606

## Key Points

- Comprehensive systematic review of 172 articles (1990-2024) examining ear abnormalities across multiple related conditions
- Cochlear complaints (tinnitus, hearing loss, hyperacusis) most frequent across ME/CFS and related syndromes
- Vestibular symptoms less commonly reported but present
- Multiple proposed mechanisms: viral effects, vascular impairment, autoimmune reactions, oxidative stress
- Identifies commonalities between ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, long-COVID, PoTS, and other post-infectious/autoimmune syndromes

## Methodology

Systematic review methodology examining hearing and vestibular disturbances in:
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/ME)
- Fibromyalgia (FM)
- COVID-19 and Long-COVID (PCS)
- Sick-building syndrome (SBS)
- Post-orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS)
- Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA)

Search period: January 1990 - January 2024
Total articles reviewed: 172
Focus: Cochlear (hearing/tinnitus) and vestibular (balance/vertigo) symptoms

## Results Summary

**Most Common Findings:**
- **Cochlear complaints predominant:** Tinnitus, hearing loss, hyperacusis
- **Vestibular symptoms:** Less frequent but documented (vertigo, dizziness, balance issues)
- **Cross-syndrome patterns:** Similar ear abnormalities across ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, long-COVID, PoTS

**Proposed Mechanisms:**
1. **Viral effects:** Direct viral damage to inner ear structures
2. **Vascular impairment:** Reduced blood flow to cochlea and vestibular apparatus
3. **Autoimmune reactions:** Antibodies targeting inner ear antigens
4. **Oxidative stress:** Reactive oxygen species damaging cochlear hair cells
5. **Neuroinflammation:** Central auditory pathway inflammation

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

This systematic review provides comprehensive synthesis of auditory/vestibular dysfunction across ME/CFS and related post-infectious syndromes. It establishes ear abnormalities as a consistent feature across multiple related conditions, suggesting shared pathophysiological mechanisms. The identification of multiple potential mechanisms (viral, vascular, autoimmune, oxidative) aligns with broader ME/CFS pathophysiology theories.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (systematic review in Autoimmunity Reviews, comprehensive search strategy)
- **Sample Size:** 172 articles reviewed (extensive literature synthesis)
- **Replication:** Synthesis of multiple studies across conditions
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None declared
- **Limitations:**
  - Variable quality of included studies
  - Heterogeneous diagnostic criteria across studies
  - Primarily descriptive synthesis (no meta-analysis with pooled statistics)
  - Mechanisms remain largely hypothetical
