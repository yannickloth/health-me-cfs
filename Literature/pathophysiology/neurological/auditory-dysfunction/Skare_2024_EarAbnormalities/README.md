Ear abnormalities in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (FM), Coronavirus-19 infectious disease (COVID) and long-COVID syndrome (PCS), sick-building syndrome (SBS), post-orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), and autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA): A systematic review. *Autoimmunity Reviews*. 2024;23(10):103606. doi:10.1016/j.autrev.2024.103606

## Study Type
Systematic review

## Summary
Comprehensive systematic review of 172 articles (1990-2024) examining ear abnormalities across ME/CFS and related post-infectious/autoimmune conditions. Cochlear complaints (tinnitus, hearing loss, hyperacusis) identified as most frequent across all conditions. Four primary mechanisms proposed: viral effects, vascular impairment, autoimmune reactions, and oxidative stress.

## Key Finding
Consistent patterns of auditory dysfunction documented across ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, long-COVID, and PoTS, suggesting shared pathophysiological mechanisms.

## Significance for ME/CFS Research
- **Comprehensive evidence synthesis** establishing ear abnormalities as documented feature
- **Cross-syndrome perspective** linking ME/CFS to related conditions
- **Mechanistic hypotheses** providing therapeutic targets (vascular, antioxidant, immunomodulation)
- **Clinical recommendation** for systematic auditory assessment in ME/CFS patients

## Quality Assessment
- **Study Type:** Systematic review (highest level of evidence synthesis)
- **Scope:** 172 articles reviewed (extensive literature base)
- **Journal:** *Autoimmunity Reviews* (high-impact, peer-reviewed)
- **Limitations:** Heterogeneous study quality, primarily descriptive (no meta-analysis)

## Proposed Mechanisms
1. **Viral effects** - Direct viral damage to inner ear structures
2. **Vascular impairment** - Reduced blood flow to cochlea
3. **Autoimmune reactions** - Antibodies targeting inner ear antigens
4. **Oxidative stress** - ROS damaging cochlear hair cells
