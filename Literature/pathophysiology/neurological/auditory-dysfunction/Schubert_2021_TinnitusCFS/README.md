## Study Type
Population-based cross-sectional epidemiological study

## Summary
First large-scale population study (n=124,609) demonstrating significant association between chronic fatigue syndrome and constant tinnitus (OR 1.568). The study identified functional somatic syndromes as a novel risk category for tinnitus beyond traditional audiological causes.

## Key Finding
ME/CFS patients have approximately 57% increased odds of experiencing constant tinnitus compared to the general population.

## Significance for ME/CFS Research
- **First large-scale epidemiological evidence** linking ME/CFS to tinnitus
- Supports hypothesis of auditory/neurological dysfunction in ME/CFS
- Identifies shared pathophysiology between functional somatic syndromes and sensory disturbances
- Suggests tinnitus screening may be clinically relevant for ME/CFS patients

## Quality Assessment
- **Sample Size:** Exceptionally large (n=124,609)
- **Study Design:** Population-based cohort (high external validity)
- **Peer Review:** Published in *Hearing Research* (reputable journal)
- **Limitations:** Cross-sectional (no causality), self-reported CFS diagnosis
