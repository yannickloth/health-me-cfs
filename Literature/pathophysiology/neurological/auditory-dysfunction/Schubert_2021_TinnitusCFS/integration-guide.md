**File:** `contents/part2-pathophysiology/ch08-neurological.tex`
**Section hint:** "Auditory and sensory dysfunction" or "Central nervous system manifestations"
**Environment type:** `achievement`
**Rationale:** Large-scale epidemiological study (n=124,609) with statistically significant finding worthy of achievement environment. Complements existing auditory processing evidence.

\begin{achievement}[Tinnitus-ME/CFS Epidemiological Association]
\label{ach:schubert2021-tinnitus}
Schubert et al.~\cite{Schubert2021} provided the first large-scale epidemiological evidence linking ME/CFS to tinnitus in a Dutch population cohort study (n=124,609). ME/CFS patients demonstrated 1.57 times higher odds (OR 1.568) of experiencing constant tinnitus compared to the general population, identifying functional somatic syndromes as a novel risk category beyond traditional audiological causes. This finding supports auditory/neurological dysfunction as a component of ME/CFS pathophysiology.

### Secondary Target: ch13-integrative-models.tex
**File:** `contents/part2-pathophysiology/ch13-integrative-models.tex`
**Section hint:** "Multi-system involvement" or "Sensory pathway dysfunction"
**Suggested inline citation:**
```latex
Sensory system involvement extends to auditory pathways, with population studies demonstrating increased tinnitus prevalence in ME/CFS patients~\cite{Schubert2021}.
```

### Tertiary Target: ch05-progression.tex or ch05-subgroups.tex
**File:** `contents/part1-clinical/ch05-progression.tex` or `ch05-subgroups.tex`
**Section hint:** "Symptom clusters" or "Clinical phenotypes"
**Suggested inline citation:**
```latex
A subset of patients reports persistent tinnitus, with epidemiological studies showing 57\% increased odds in ME/CFS populations~\cite{Schubert2021}.
```

## Key Points to Convey
1. **First large-scale evidence:** This is the inaugural population-based study (n=124,609) demonstrating CFS-tinnitus association
2. **Quantitative finding:** OR 1.568 (approximately 57% increased odds) - specific, statistically significant
3. **Novel category:** Identifies functional somatic syndromes as risk factor, expanding beyond traditional audiological causes
4. **Epidemiological strength:** Large sample size provides high confidence in association

## Certainty Assessment for Integration
- **Quality:** High (large population-based cohort, peer-reviewed in Hearing Research)
- **Sample:** n=124,609 (exceptionally large for epidemiological study)
- **Replication:** First large-scale study; awaiting independent replication
- **Limitations:** Cross-sectional design (cannot establish causality); self-reported CFS diagnosis (not clinically verified)

## Cross-References
- **Related papers:**
  - Johnson1996 (auditory processing deficits) - cite together to show convergent evidence
  - Nelson2021 (brainstem MRI abnormalities) - potential mechanistic explanation
  - Skare2024 (systematic review of ear abnormalities) - places finding in broader context
- **Related sections:**
  - Chapter 8 (neurological dysfunction) - primary home
  - Chapter 13 (integrative models) - multi-system perspective
  - Chapter 5 (clinical presentation) - symptom documentation

## Integration Strategy
**Narrative flow:**
1. Start with Johnson1996 (1996 auditory processing deficits - historical evidence)
2. Add Schubert2021 (2021 population-level tinnitus association - epidemiological scale)
3. Connect to Nelson2021 (2021 brainstem abnormalities - potential mechanism)
4. Reference Skare2024 (2024 systematic review - comprehensive context)

This creates a progression from specific cognitive finding → population epidemiology → neuroanatomical substrate → systematic evidence synthesis.
