**DOI:** 10.1016/j.heares.2021.108355

## Key Points

- Large population-based study (n=124,609) examining tinnitus prevalence and disease associations
- 6.4% reported constant tinnitus; 31.8% reported any tinnitus
- First large-scale epidemiological evidence linking ME/CFS to tinnitus (OR 1.568 for constant tinnitus)
- Novel associations found with functional somatic syndromes beyond traditional audiological causes

## Methodology

Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of Dutch Lifelines cohort data (>167,000 initial participants). Participants completed comprehensive health questionnaires including tinnitus presence, severity, and associated conditions. Statistical analysis examined associations between tinnitus (any vs. constant) and various health conditions, controlling for confounders.

## Results Summary

**Tinnitus Prevalence:**
- Constant tinnitus: 6.4% of population
- Any tinnitus: 31.8% of population

**Disease Associations with Constant Tinnitus:**
- Hearing difficulties (confirmed)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (confirmed)
- Major depression (confirmed)
- **Chronic fatigue syndrome: OR 1.568** (novel finding)
- Inflammatory conditions (novel)
- Thyroid disease (novel)

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

This is the first large-scale epidemiological evidence demonstrating a significant association between ME/CFS and tinnitus. The odds ratio of 1.568 suggests that ME/CFS patients are approximately 57% more likely to experience constant tinnitus compared to the general population. This finding supports the hypothesis of auditory/neurological dysfunction as a component of ME/CFS pathophysiology.

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (large population-based cohort, peer-reviewed in Hearing Research)
- **Sample Size:** n=124,609 (exceptionally large)
- **Replication:** First large-scale study; awaiting replication
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None declared
- **Limitations:** Cross-sectional design (cannot establish causality); self-reported CFS diagnosis (not clinically verified with diagnostic criteria)
