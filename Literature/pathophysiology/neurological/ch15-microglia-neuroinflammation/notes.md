### 1. VanElzakker2019 — Critical Methods Review
**Authors:** VanElzakker MB, Brumfield SA, Lara Mejia PS
**Journal:** Frontiers in Neurology, 2019, Vol. 9, p. 1033
**DOI:** 10.3389/fneur.2018.01033 | PMID: 30687207

**Key Points:**
- Critiques methodological inconsistencies across PET, MRS, and cytokine studies of neuroinflammation in ME/CFS
- Argues most neuroimaging studies fail to adequately target the brainstem, which is "probably central" to neuroinflammatory causes
- Peripheral cytokine profiling unreliable for diagnosis due to measurement variability and biological complexity
- Positions TSPO-PET as the strongest available method but notes second-generation ligands needed

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Quality: High (peer-reviewed, Frontiers in Neurology)
- Design: Critical review/methods paper — not empirical
- Limitations: Review only; no new data generated

### 2. RenzPolster2022 — Neuroglial Failure Hypothesis
**Authors:** Renz-Polster H, Tremblay ME, Bienzle D, Fischer JE
**Journal:** Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, 2022, Vol. 16, p. 888232
**DOI:** 10.3389/fncel.2022.888232 | PMID: 35614970

**Key Points:**
- Proposes impaired/pathologically reactive neuroglia (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes) as the "common denominator" of ME/CFS pathobiology
- Microglia in ME/CFS shift toward a reactive (M1-like) state, releasing pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, ROS)
- Complement cascade (C1q, C3) may tag synapses for excess pruning by reactive microglia — contributing to cognitive symptoms
- Neuroglial dysfunction could explain PEM: metabolic demands during activity cannot be met, causing glial-mediated energy failure
- Directly relevant to Long COVID overlap

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Quality: High (peer-reviewed, Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience; authors include Marie-Eve Tremblay, a leading microglia researcher)
- Design: Hypothesis/narrative review — mechanistic framework, not clinical trial
- Limitations: No original data; many elements are extrapolated from other diseases

### 3. Gottschalk2022ATG13 — ATG13 Drives Microglial Oxidative Stress
**Authors:** Gottschalk CG, Peterson D, Knox K, Maynard M, Whelan RJ
**Journal:** Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, 2022, Vol. 120, p. 103731
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.mcn.2022.103731 | PMID: 35487443

**Key Points:**
- ME/CFS patient serum directly stimulates ROS and nitric oxide production in human HMC3 microglial cells in vitro
- ATG13 (autophagy-related protein 13) is elevated in ME/CFS serum and identified as the active factor
- ATG13 acts via RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) on microglia
- ATG13 neutralization substantially reduces microglial oxidative stress response
- Provides direct mechanistic link: circulating ME/CFS factors activate microglia via RAGE/ATG13 axis

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Quality: Medium (peer-reviewed, Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience)
- Design: In vitro mechanistic study — cell culture
- Sample: Human serum from ME/CFS patients tested on HMC3 cell line
- Limitations: In vitro only; does not demonstrate this occurs in vivo in ME/CFS patients; sample size not specified in abstract
- Replication: Single study, needs independent confirmation

### 4. Miwa2021minocycline — Minocycline Clinical Trial
**Authors:** Miwa K
**Journal:** Internal Medicine, 2021, Vol. 60(16), pp. 2577–2584
**DOI:** 10.2169/internalmedicine.6082-20 | PMID: 33896862

**Key Points:**
- Open-label trial: oral minocycline 100 mg/day for 42 days in 100 ME patients
- 27% showed favorable response (performance status improvement ≥2 points)
- Best response in patients within 6 months of disease onset (early-stage disease)
- Rationale: minocycline inhibits microglial activation, reduces neuroinflammatory cytokines
- 38% discontinued due to adverse effects (nausea, dizziness, photosensitivity)

**Acronym Definitions:**
- ME: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (the term Miwa uses — Japan-centric terminology)

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Quality: Low-Medium (Internal Medicine, open-label, no control group, single site, Japan)
- Sample: n=100
- Design: Prospective open-label, no placebo control
- Limitations: No randomization, no blinding; selection bias; 38% dropout; Japanese cohort may not generalize
- Replication: Limited; see also Miwa 2024 pilot (PMID 39720104)

### 5. Numata2021minocycline — Editorial Commentary
**Authors:** Numata T
**Journal:** Internal Medicine, 2021, Vol. 60(16), pp. 2527–2528
**DOI:** 10.2169/internalmedicine.7182-21 | PMID: 33814504

**Key Points:**
- Editorial response to Miwa 2021; argues minocycline mechanism (microglial suppression) is theoretically sound
- Cautions against "magic bullet" framing given ME/CFS heterogeneity
- Advocates stratified patient classification before testing targeted interventions
- Useful for framing limitations in text: mechanism plausible but effect size modest and patient-dependent

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Quality: Expert opinion/editorial (not empirical)
- Limitations: No data; purely analytical
