## Study Type
Scoping review of MRI neuroimaging studies

## Summary
Scoping review of 11 MRI studies documenting both structural changes (white and gray matter) and functional connectivity abnormalities in the brainstem of ME/CFS patients. Four mechanisms proposed: astrocyte dysfunction, cerebral perfusion impairment, impaired nerve conduction, and neuroinflammation. Brainstem involvement provides unifying explanation for heterogeneous ME/CFS symptoms.

## Key Finding
Convergent MRI evidence from multiple independent studies demonstrates brainstem pathology in ME/CFS, affecting regions critical for autonomic function, sensory processing, arousal, and motor control.

## Significance for ME/CFS Research
- **Anatomical substrate:** Provides structural/neuroanatomical basis for functional symptoms
- **Unifying framework:** Single brain region (brainstem) controls multiple affected systems
- **Diagnostic potential:** MRI may offer objective biomarker
- **Auditory connection:** Explains auditory dysfunction (brainstem contains auditory processing pathways)
- **Therapeutic targets:** Brainstem-specific interventions (perfusion, neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory)

## Quality Assessment
- **Study Type:** Scoping review (evidence synthesis)
- **Studies Reviewed:** 11 MRI studies (limited but convergent findings)
- **Journal:** *Frontiers in Neurology* (peer-reviewed)
- **Limitations:** Small sample sizes in individual studies; heterogeneous methodologies; mechanisms hypothetical

## Brainstem Functions Relevant to ME/CFS
1. **Autonomic control** → Dysautonomia, POTS, orthostatic intolerance
2. **Auditory processing** → Auditory deficits, tinnitus (Johnson1996, Schubert2021)
3. **Arousal/consciousness** → Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction
4. **Sensory modulation** → Pain, hyperalgesia, sensory sensitivities
5. **Motor coordination** → Balance issues, vestibular symptoms

## Proposed Mechanisms
1. **Astrocyte dysfunction** - Glial cell abnormalities affecting neural support
2. **Cerebral perfusion impairment** - Reduced blood flow to brainstem
3. **Impaired nerve conduction** - Demyelination or axonal damage
4. **Neuroinflammation** - Inflammatory processes in brainstem tissue
