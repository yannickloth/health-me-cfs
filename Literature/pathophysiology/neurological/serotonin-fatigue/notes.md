### 1. Yamashita 2020 — Fatigue Circuit Model

**Authors:** Masatoshi Yamashita
**Journal:** International Journal of Tryptophan Research, 2020, vol. 13
**DOI:** 10.1177/1178646920936279
**PMID:** 32647476; PMCID: PMC7325545
**BibTeX key:** `Yamashita2020fatigue`

**Key Points:**
- Proposes three-stage "fatigue circuit": tryptophan + kynurenine enter brain -> kynurenic acid produced in hypothalamus-hippocampal circuit -> cognitive and fatigue symptoms
- Serotonin release is transient during exercise and does not track fatigue duration
- 95% of tryptophan is metabolised via kynurenine pathway under normal conditions
- Blood-brain barrier breakdown in central fatigue allows free tryptophan/kynurenine entry
- Kynurenic acid suppresses glutamate and dopamine, causing cognitive impairment

**Methodology:** Narrative review integrating animal model studies

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Study Quality: Medium (review, not original data)
- Sample Size: N/A (review)
- Replication: Reviewed multiple independent studies
- Conflicts of Interest: Not stated

**Acronym Definitions:**
- KP: Kynurenine Pathway
- 5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)

### 2. Maes et al. 2013 — Anti-5-HT Autoantibodies in ME/CFS

**Authors:** Michael Maes, Karl Ringel, Marta Kubera, George Anderson, Gerwyn Morris, Piotr Galecki, Michel Geffard
**Journal:** Journal of Affective Disorders, 2013, vol. 150(2), pp. 223-230
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jad.2013.03.029
**PMID:** 23664637
**BibTeX key:** `Maes2013serotonin`

**Key Points:**
- Anti-5-HT autoantibody positivity: 61.5% in ME/CFS vs 13.9% in chronic fatigue vs 5.7% in controls
- ME/CFS patients with anti-5-HT antibodies show elevated TNF-alpha, IL-1, neopterin
- Elevated IgA to gram-negative LPS suggests gut bacterial translocation co-occurs
- Anti-5-HT positivity correlates with: hyperalgesia, fatigue severity, neurocognitive dysfunction, autonomic disturbances, mood changes, flu-like malaise

**Methodology:** Case-control comparison; immunoassay for anti-5-HT antibodies

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Study Quality: Medium (single research group, Maes lab)
- Sample Size: ME/CFS n=104, CF n=36, controls n=35
- Replication: Limited independent replication
- Conflicts of Interest: Not stated

### 3. Noda et al. 2018 — Glial Activation and 5-HTT in CFS

**Authors:** Mami Noda, Masataka Ifuku, Md Shamim Hossain, Toshihiko Katafuchi
**Journal:** Frontiers in Psychiatry, 2018, vol. 9, p. 589
**DOI:** 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00589
**PMID:** 30505285; PMCID: PMC6250825
**BibTeX key:** `Noda2018glial`

**Key Points:**
- Mechanistic chain: viral mimic -> increased BBB permeability -> microglial TLR3 activation -> IL-1beta secretion -> astrocytic 5-HTT upregulation -> reduced extracellular serotonin -> impaired 5-HT1A signalling
- Proposes neuroinflammation (microglia + astrocytes) as central mechanism in CFS
- Targets: microglial IL-1beta and astrocytic 5-HTT as therapeutic intervention points

**Methodology:** Review + mechanistic model; cell/rodent experimental data

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Study Quality: Medium (mechanistic review with supporting experimental data)
- Sample Size: N/A (review + model)
- Replication: Consistent with broader neuroinflammation literature
- Conflicts of Interest: Not stated

### 4. Smith et al. 2008 — HTR2A Genetics in CFS

**Authors:** Alicia K Smith, Irina Dimulescu, Virginia R Falkenberg, Supraja Narasimhan, Christine Heim, Suzanne D Vernon, Mangalathu S Rajeevan
**Journal:** Psychoneuroendocrinology, 2008, vol. 33(2), pp. 188-197
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.11.001
**PMID:** 18079067
**BibTeX key:** `Smith2008HTR2A`

**Key Points:**
- 77 polymorphisms screened across multiple serotonin-related genes
- Three HTR2A markers significantly associated with CFS vs non-fatigued controls
- rs6311 A-allele increases HTR2A promoter activity; creates Th1/E47 transcription factor binding site
- Suggests enhanced 5-HT2A receptor expression may contribute to CFS pathophysiology
- Consistent associations between HTR2A variants and quantitative disability and fatigue measures

**Methodology:** Case-control genetic association study; PCR-based polymorphism analysis

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Study Quality: Medium (peer-reviewed, but single genetic study)
- Sample Size: n=137 (40 CFS, 55 insufficient fatigue, 42 controls)
- Replication: No independent replication found in literature search
- Conflicts of Interest: CDC-funded study (Rajeevan, Vernon are CDC employees)

### 5. Narita et al. 2003 — 5-HTT Gene Polymorphism in CFS

**Authors:** Masaaki Narita, Naoko Nishigami, Naoko Narita, Kouzi Yamaguti, Nobuo Okado, Yasuyoshi Watanabe, Hirohiko Kuratsune
**Journal:** Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 2003, vol. 311(2), pp. 264-266
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.207
**PMID:** 14592408
**BibTeX key:** `Narita2003transporter`

**Key Points:**
- Significant increase of longer L and XL allelic variants of 5-HTT promoter in CFS patients vs controls
- Longer variants may reduce extracellular serotonin availability
- Authors connect serotonergic dysfunction to HPA axis disruption in CFS

**Methodology:** Genetic association; PCR analysis of blood genomic DNA

**Certainty Assessment:**
- Study Quality: Low-Medium (small n, early study)
- Sample Size: n=78 CFS patients + controls
- Replication: Older study; some subsequent literature (e.g. Smith2008) examined related genes
- Conflicts of Interest: Not stated
