# Key Findings: ANLS Dysfunction as ME/CFS Mechanism

## Main Findings

1. **Brain lactate is elevated in ME/CFS:** Multiple MRS studies document elevated lactate in specific brain regions (ACC, insula, thalamus, cerebellum) in ME/CFS patients, consistent with anaerobic metabolism or impaired lactate clearance/utilization (Godlewska 2025, Mueller 2020).

2. **ANLS dysfunction causes neurodegeneration in other diseases:** Alzheimer's, ALS, epilepsy, and depression all show disrupted astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling, particularly MCT downregulation (Kim 2025 review). MCT1/MCT4 downregulation reduces neuronal lactate supply by ~60%.

3. **Reactive astrocytes alter metabolism:** Neuroinflammation causes astrocyte metabolic reprogramming -- initially increased glycolysis (more lactate), but chronic shifts impair mitochondrial function and may paradoxically reduce effective lactate delivery to neurons.

4. **Neurons have some metabolic flexibility:** Recent evidence shows neurons express LDHA and can oxidize glucose directly, but this may be insufficient during high demand. The ANLS is most critical during activity-dependent energy surges.

5. **Ketone bodies bypass the ANLS bottleneck:** BHB and acetoacetate enter neurons via MCT2 and are oxidized directly in neuronal mitochondria, providing an ANLS-independent energy source.

6. **Exogenous lactate improves cognition in disease models:** L-lactate administration restores synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in Alzheimer's models (200 mg/kg restored hippocampal and CSF lactate levels).

## Clinical Implications

- Brain lactate MRS could serve as a biomarker for ANLS dysfunction severity
- Ketogenic diet has a mechanistic rationale in ME/CFS beyond general metabolic support
- Exogenous lactate supplementation could bypass the astrocyte glucose-to-lactate step
- MCT expression profiling in accessible tissues may reflect CNS transporter status

## Limitations

- No study has directly measured ANLS flux in ME/CFS patients
- Elevated brain lactate could reflect overproduction (anaerobic glycolysis) rather than underutilization
- MRS studies have small sample sizes (n=15-24)
- The ANLS model itself is debated -- neurons may use more direct glucose than originally thought
- GLUT1 studies show paradoxical results (astrocyte GLUT1 reduction can improve glucose metabolism)
