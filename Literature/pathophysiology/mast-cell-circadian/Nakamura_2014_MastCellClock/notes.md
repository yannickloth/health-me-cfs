**PMID:** 24060274

## Key Points

- **Mast cells have intrinsic circadian clocks** that drive 24-hour rhythms in responsiveness
- **Clock gene mutation abolishes temporal variation** in mast cell degranulation both in vivo and in vitro
- **Adrenal gland signals entrain mast cell clocks** - adrenalectomy disrupts mast cell circadian rhythms
- **FcεRI expression and signaling are clock-controlled** - mechanism for time-of-day variation in allergic responses

## Methodology

**Genetic Models:**
- Clock-mutant mice (dominant negative Clock allele)
- Mast cell-deficient mice (W/Wv)
- Mast cell reconstitution with WT or Clock-mutant BMMCs

**Experiments:**
- **In vivo:** Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) at different times of day
- **In vitro:** BMMC degranulation assays at different circadian phases
- **Mechanistic:** FcεRI expression and signaling pathway analysis
- **Entrainment:** Adrenalectomy to test hormonal regulation

**Measurements:**
- β-hexosaminidase release (degranulation)
- FcεRI surface expression (flow cytometry)
- Signaling pathway activation (Western blot)
- In vivo imaging of clock gene expression (luciferase reporters)

## Results Summary

**Circadian Variation in Mast Cell Function:**
- WT mice: Strong time-of-day effect on PCA severity (peak in early active phase)
- Clock-mutant mast cells: Complete loss of temporal variation (flat response curve)
- In vitro: Circadian rhythm persisted in WT cells, absent in Clock-mutant cells

**Mechanism:**
- FcεRI expression: Circadian rhythm in WT (peak at ZT14-18), absent in Clock-mutant
- Signaling: Temporal variation in phosphorylation of Syk, LAT, and ERK in WT only
- Clock genes: Rhythmic expression in WT mast cells, disrupted in Clock-mutant

**Entrainment by Adrenal Signals:**
- Adrenalectomy: Abolished mast cell clock rhythms in vivo
- Glucocorticoids: Likely entrainment signal (known circadian hormone)
- Systemic-to-cellular: Demonstrates hierarchical clock organization

## Relevance to ME/CFS Documentation

**Temporal Priming Hypothesis:**
This paper provides foundational evidence for the "temporal priming hypothesis" - that mast cell responsiveness varies with time of day due to intrinsic circadian regulation. This has several implications for ME/CFS:

**1. Symptom Timing Patterns:**
- Many ME/CFS patients report worse symptoms at specific times of day
- If mast cells contribute to symptoms, circadian clock control could explain timing
- Suggests optimal treatment timing (chronotherapy)

**2. Stress-Clock Interactions:**
- Adrenal hormones entrain mast cell clocks
- HPA axis dysfunction in ME/CFS could disrupt mast cell circadian rhythms
- Chronic stress may cause clock desynchronization → inappropriate mast cell activation

**3. Sleep Disruption Consequences:**
- Circadian disruption is common in ME/CFS
- Clock gene dysfunction could amplify mast cell reactivity
- May explain why sleep disturbance worsens ME/CFS symptoms

**4. Therapeutic Implications:**
- **Chronotherapy:** Time mast cell stabilizers to peak reactivity periods
- **Clock restoration:** Interventions to strengthen circadian rhythms (light therapy, melatonin)
- **HPA axis support:** May indirectly improve mast cell regulation

**5. Research Directions:**
- Test whether ME/CFS patients have disrupted mast cell clock function
- Examine correlation between circadian dysfunction severity and mast cell activation markers
- Investigate whether circadian interventions reduce mast cell-mediated symptoms

## Certainty Assessment

- **Study Quality:** High (elegant genetic dissection, multiple complementary approaches, mechanistic depth)
- **Sample Size:** Adequate for animal studies (n=5-10 per group per timepoint)
- **Replication:** Findings confirmed in multiple experimental systems (in vivo, in vitro, multiple assays)
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None declared
- **Limitations:**
  - Mouse studies - human translation not confirmed
  - Clock-mutant is not a complete loss-of-function (dominant negative)
  - Allergy model (IgE) - unclear if non-IgE mast cell activation is similarly regulated
  - No direct ME/CFS relevance tested

## Model Proposed

```
Central Clock (SCN)
       ↓
Adrenal Gland (glucocorticoid rhythm)
       ↓ Entrainment
Mast Cell Clock (Clock/Bmal1)
       ↓ Regulates
FcεRI expression + Signaling components
       ↓ Modulates
Mast Cell Degranulation (time-of-day dependent)
       ↓
Allergic Symptoms (circadian pattern)
```

**ME/CFS Extension:**
```
HPA Axis Dysfunction
       ↓ Disrupted entrainment
Mast Cell Clock Desynchronization
       ↓ Inappropriate timing
Mast Cell Activation (random/excessive)
       ↓
ME/CFS Symptoms (unpredictable timing)
```
