# Integration Guide: Nakamura 2014

## Paper Citation Key
**BibTeX key:** `Nakamura2014`

## Recommended Chapters for Integration

### Primary Target: ch14-speculative-hypotheses.tex
**File:** `contents/part2-pathophysiology/ch14-speculative-hypotheses.tex`
**Section hint:** "Temporal Priming Hypothesis" or mast cell section
**Environment type:** `hypothesis`
**Rationale:** Animal model with clear mechanism, but ME/CFS connection is extrapolation

**Suggested LaTeX:**
```latex
\begin{hypothesis}[Circadian Dysregulation of Mast Cells]
\label{hyp:mast-cell-circadian}
Nakamura et al.~\cite{Nakamura2014} demonstrated that mast cells possess intrinsic
circadian clocks entrained by adrenal hormones, with Clock gene mutation abolishing
time-of-day variation in degranulation (mouse model, High certainty for mechanism).
Given HPA axis dysfunction in ME/CFS, disrupted circadian entrainment could cause
inappropriate mast cell activation timing, potentially explaining symptom patterns
and sleep-symptom interactions (extrapolation to ME/CFS: speculative).
\end{hypothesis}
```

### Secondary Target: ch07-immune-dysfunction.tex
**File:** `contents/part2-pathophysiology/ch07-immune-dysfunction.tex`
**Section hint:** "Mast cell regulation" or "Chronobiology of immune function"
**Suggested inline citation:**
```latex
Mast cell responsiveness exhibits circadian variation driven by cell-intrinsic
clock genes entrained by adrenal hormones~\cite{Nakamura2014}, suggesting that
HPA axis dysfunction could disrupt temporal regulation of mast cell activation.
```

## Key Points to Convey
1. Mast cells have functional circadian clocks (Clock gene-dependent)
2. Adrenal hormones entrain these clocks (adrenalectomy disrupts rhythms)
3. Clock controls FcεRI expression and signaling (mechanistic link)
4. HPA dysfunction in ME/CFS could disrupt this system (extrapolation)

## Certainty Assessment
- **Mechanism:** High (elegant genetics, multiple assays, replicated)
- **ME/CFS relevance:** Low-Medium (extrapolation from mouse allergy model)
- **Overall:** Medium certainty for hypothesis

## Cross-References
- Nakao2018, Christ2018 (related circadian mast cell papers)
