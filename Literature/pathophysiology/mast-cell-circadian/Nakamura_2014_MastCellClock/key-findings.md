# Key Findings: Mast Cell Circadian Clock

## Main Findings

1. **Mast cells have cell-autonomous circadian clocks:** Clock gene mutation abolishes temporal variation in degranulation (in vivo and in vitro)

2. **Adrenal hormones entrain mast cell clocks:** Adrenalectomy disrupts mast cell circadian rhythms

3. **FcεRI is clock-regulated:** Expression and signaling show circadian rhythms in WT cells, lost in Clock-mutant

4. **Functional consequence:** Time-of-day variation in allergic reactions depends on mast cell clock

## Clinical Implications for ME/CFS

- **Symptom timing:** Mast cell clock dysfunction could explain time-of-day symptom patterns
- **HPA axis link:** HPA dysfunction in ME/CFS may disrupt mast cell temporal regulation
- **Chronotherapy potential:** Time mast cell treatments to peak reactivity periods
- **Sleep-symptom connection:** Circadian disruption may amplify mast cell activation

## Limitations

- Mouse studies only - human validation needed
- Allergy model (IgE-mediated) - other mast cell triggers not tested
- No direct ME/CFS relevance examined

## Integration Points

### Chapter 14: Speculative Hypotheses
- Could support: Temporal priming hypothesis for mast cell dysfunction
- Cites as: **hypothesis** (animal model evidence, ME/CFS connection is extrapolation)

### Chapter 7: Immune Dysfunction (Mast Cell section)
- Could support: Mechanisms regulating mast cell activation
- Cites as: **achievement** (for basic mechanism) + **hypothesis** (for ME/CFS relevance)
