## Summary
Demonstrates that mast cells have intrinsic circadian clocks that drive time-of-day variation in degranulation. Clock gene mutation abolishes this rhythm, and adrenalectomy disrupts mast cell clocks, showing that adrenal hormones entrain mast cell circadian function.

## Relevance to ME/CFS
Provides mechanistic basis for "temporal priming hypothesis" - HPA axis dysfunction in ME/CFS could disrupt mast cell circadian regulation, leading to inappropriate activation timing. May explain symptom timing patterns and sleep-symptom interactions.
