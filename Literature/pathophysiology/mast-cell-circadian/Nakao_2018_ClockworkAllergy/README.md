# Clockwork Allergy: Circadian Clock and Allergic Reactions (Nakao, 2018)

## Citation
Nakao A. Clockwork allergy: How the circadian clock underpins allergic reactions. *J Allergy Clin Immunol*. 2018;142(4):1021-1031. doi:10.1016/j.jaci.2018.08.007. PMID: 30293559.

## Summary
Comprehensive review synthesizing how circadian clocks regulate allergic reactions. Key insight: Clock disruption doesn't just affect timing - it enhances severity and increases susceptibility to allergic disease. Proposes lifestyle interventions and clock modifiers as therapeutic approaches.

## Relevance to ME/CFS
- **Clock disruption amplifies pathology:** Suggests circadian dysfunction in ME/CFS could worsen mast cell activation beyond just timing
- **Lifestyle-disease interaction:** Modern circadian disruption (common in ME/CFS) may increase disease susceptibility
- **Therapeutic targets:** Clock restoration (light therapy, melatonin, scheduled routines) may reduce mast cell-mediated symptoms
