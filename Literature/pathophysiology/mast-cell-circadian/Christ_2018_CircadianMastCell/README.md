# Circadian Clock Drives Mast Cell Functions (Christ et al., 2018)

## Citation
Christ P, Sowa AS, Froy O, Lorentz A. The circadian clock drives mast cell functions in allergic reactions. *Front Immunol*. 2018;9:1526. doi:10.3389/fimmu.2018.01526. PMID: 30034393. PMCID: PMC6043637.

## Summary
Review article connecting circadian clocks, mast cells, and allergic disease. Emphasizes that mast cells are controlled by both internal clocks (clock genes) and external factors (light, hormones, diet). Advocates for chronotherapy approaches that consider rhythmic nature of mast cell responses.

## Relevance to ME/CFS
- **Entrainment factors:** Light, hormones, diet all affect mast cell clocks - provides multiple intervention points
- **Chronotherapy:** Timing of treatments matters for mast cell stabilizers
- **Bidirectional:** Immune responses generated by mast cells also show circadian patterns
