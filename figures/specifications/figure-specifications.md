# ME/CFS Process Flow Figure Specifications

This document provides detailed specifications for biological process flow diagrams. Each figure clearly distinguishes:

1. **NORMAL PROCESS** (green): What SHOULD happen in healthy individuals
2. **ME/CFS IMPAIRMENT** (red): Where normal processes break down
3. **PATHOLOGICAL PROCESS** (dark red/black): Abnormal processes that SHOULD NOT EXIST but do in ME/CFS, and how they corrupt normal function
4. **INTERVENTIONS**: Where treatments can help or harm

## Target Audience & Accessibility

### Who Should Understand These Figures

The target reader is **anyone interested in ME/CFS with at least a university degree in any field**. This means:
- Patients and their families seeking to understand the disease
- Healthcare providers unfamiliar with ME/CFS
- Researchers from adjacent fields
- Policy makers and advocates
- Journalists covering the condition

**Medical or biology background is NOT required.**

### Plain Language Requirements

Every figure must include:

1. **Plain-language title** alongside technical name
   - Technical: "Oxidative Phosphorylation Cascade"
   - Plain: "How Your Cells Make Energy (And Why It Fails in ME/CFS)"

2. **Jargon glossary box** on each figure defining key terms in simple language

3. **Everyday analogies** where helpful (see examples below)

4. **"What This Means For You" summary** translating the science into lived experience

### Glossary of Key Terms (Include Relevant Terms on Each Figure)

| Technical Term | Plain Language Explanation |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **ATP** | The "energy currency" of cells—like the electricity that powers everything in your body |
| **Mitochondria** | The "power plants" inside each cell that produce ATP |
| **Electron Transport Chain (ETC)** | The "assembly line" in mitochondria that produces most of your cellular energy |
| **ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species)** | Damaging byproducts—like exhaust fumes from the cellular power plant |
| **Oxidative stress** | When damaging byproducts overwhelm your body's cleanup systems |
| **Antioxidants** | Your body's cleanup crew that neutralizes damaging byproducts |
| **Neurotransmitters** | Chemical messengers that brain cells use to communicate |
| **Catecholamines** | A family of neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, adrenaline) that control alertness, mood, and automatic body functions |
| **Autonomic nervous system** | The "autopilot" system controlling heart rate, blood pressure, digestion—things you don't consciously control |
| **POTS** | A condition where standing up causes abnormal heart rate increase because the automatic blood pressure system isn't working right |
| **Cytokines** | Signal molecules the immune system uses to communicate—like text messages between immune cells |
| **Inflammation** | The immune system's response to threat—helpful when fighting infection, harmful when chronic |
| **Vicious cycle** | When a problem creates more of the same problem, trapping the body in a loop of dysfunction |
| **Cofactor** | A helper molecule that an enzyme needs to do its job—like a key needed to start an engine |
| **BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin)** | A cofactor needed to make neurotransmitters—when it's damaged, neurotransmitter production stops |
| **Tryptophan** | An amino acid from food that your body uses to make serotonin (mood) and melatonin (sleep) |
| **Kynurenine pathway** | An alternative processing route for tryptophan that produces some toxic byproducts |
| **IDO (enzyme)** | A switch that diverts tryptophan away from serotonin production—overactivated by inflammation |
| **Excitotoxicity** | When brain cells are overstimulated to the point of damage—like burning out a motor by running it too hard |
| **PEM (Post-Exertional Malaise)** | The characteristic ME/CFS crash that occurs 12-48 hours after exceeding your energy limits |
| **Anaerobic threshold** | The point where your body switches from efficient to inefficient energy production—much lower in ME/CFS |
| **Cerebral hypoperfusion** | Reduced blood flow to the brain—like trying to run a computer on low power |

### Analogy Library (Use Where Appropriate)

**Energy Production = Factory**
> Think of your cells as factories. Glucose (sugar) is the raw material. Mitochondria are the power plants that convert it to ATP (electricity). In ME/CFS, the power plants are damaged—they produce less electricity and more pollution (ROS).

**Oxidative Stress = Pollution**
> Your cells produce small amounts of "pollution" (ROS) as a byproduct of making energy. Normally, cleanup crews (antioxidants) handle this. In ME/CFS, the damaged power plants produce too much pollution, and the cleanup crews are overwhelmed and understaffed.

**Vicious Cycle = Feedback Loop**
> Imagine a microphone too close to a speaker—the sound feeds back and gets louder and louder. Similarly, damage causes dysfunction, which causes more damage, which causes more dysfunction. The body gets stuck in a self-reinforcing loop.

**Catecholamine Synthesis = Production Line**
> Your brain needs a production line to make alertness chemicals. This line needs specific parts (cofactors) to run. In ME/CFS, a key part (BH4) is destroyed by pollution from the damaged power plants, so the production line stalls.

**Kynurenine Trap = Wrong Turn**
> Tryptophan from your food should go mostly toward making serotonin (mood chemical) and melatonin (sleep chemical). Inflammation forces it to take a wrong turn toward a pathway that produces toxic waste instead. You lose what you need AND gain what harms you.

**PEM = Overdraft Penalty**
> Think of your energy like a bank account with a very low balance. If you spend more than you have, you don't just go to zero—you get hit with massive overdraft fees that put you deep in debt. Recovery means paying back the debt before you can spend normally again.

**Autonomic Dysfunction = Broken Thermostat**
> Your autonomic nervous system is like a thermostat that automatically adjusts your heart rate, blood pressure, and other functions. In ME/CFS, this thermostat is broken—it can't properly respond to changes like standing up.

### "What This Means For You" Template

Each figure should end with a box like:

## Figure 1: Cellular Energy Production Cascade

**Plain-language title:** "How Your Cells Make Energy (And Why It Fails in ME/CFS)"

### Filename
`fig-energy-production-cascade.pdf` / `.tikz`

### Target Chapter
`ch06-energy-metabolism.tex`

### Purpose
Show cellular ATP production: what SHOULD happen vs what ACTUALLY happens in ME/CFS, and how impaired energy production corrupts every other body system.

### Key Terms for This Figure (Include in Glossary Box)
- **ATP**: The "energy currency" cells use for everything - like electricity powering a house
- **Mitochondria**: The "power plants" inside cells that produce ATP
- **Glycolysis**: The first step of energy production (happens outside mitochondria)
- **Krebs Cycle**: The second step (inside mitochondria) - processes fuel into energy carriers
- **Electron Transport Chain**: The final step - the "assembly line" that produces most ATP
- **Lactate**: A byproduct when cells switch to inefficient "emergency" energy production

**Key Normal Features to Highlight:**
- Pyruvate efficiently converted to Acetyl-CoA (not lactate)
- Krebs cycle enzymes (especially aconitase) function normally
- ETC complexes transfer electrons with minimal leakage
- ATP synthase produces ~30-32 ATP per glucose
- Adequate ATP for all body systems

### Caption Text

**Technical caption:**
"Cellular energy production: normal vs ME/CFS. **Top panel (green)**: Normal ATP production via glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation yields 30-32 ATP per glucose, powering all cellular functions. **Middle panel (red)**: ME/CFS reality shows impairments at multiple points: premature lactate shift, aconitase inactivation, Complex I/III electron leakage, and reduced ATP synthase efficiency, resulting in significant ATP deficit. **Bottom panel (dark red)**: The ATP deficit is not merely 'tiredness' but active failure of ATP-dependent processes in muscle (weakness, PEM), brain (cognitive dysfunction), immune (T-cell activation failure), cardiovascular (ion pump failure), and autonomic (catecholamine synthesis failure) systems. Blue boxes indicate beneficial interventions; yellow boxes indicate interventions requiring caution."

**Plain-language caption:**
"How your cells make energy, and why this fails in ME/CFS. In healthy people (green), food is converted to cellular energy (ATP) through an efficient process in the mitochondria (cell power plants). In ME/CFS (red), this process breaks down at multiple points - the power plants are damaged and produce less energy while creating more toxic byproducts. Because every organ needs this energy to function (dark red), the energy shortage cascades to cause symptoms throughout the body: muscle weakness, brain fog, immune problems, heart symptoms, and autonomic dysfunction. This is not 'tiredness' - it is cellular energy failure."

### Generation Prompt for AI Image Models

"Create a three-panel scientific diagram comparing normal cellular energy production with ME/CFS:

**Panel 1 (GREEN, top)**: 'NORMAL - What SHOULD Happen' - Show healthy ATP production pathway: Glucose → Glycolysis → Krebs Cycle → Electron Transport Chain (Complexes I-IV) → ATP Synthase → 30-32 ATP. Use green arrows, clean flow, efficient process. Label output: 'Abundant ATP for all cellular functions.'

**Panel 2 (RED, middle)**: 'ME/CFS - What ACTUALLY Happens' - Same pathway but with red X markers at: (1) Pyruvate → early lactate diversion, (2) Aconitase inactivated, (3) Complex I electron leakage, (4) Complex III electron leakage, (5) Reduced ATP output. Show diminished flow, blocked pathways. Label output: 'Reduced ATP - insufficient for normal function.'

**Panel 3 (DARK RED, bottom)**: 'PATHOLOGICAL CASCADE - How This Corrupts Everything' - Show ATP deficit in center with arrows to 5 boxes: Muscle (weakness, PEM), Brain (cognitive dysfunction), Immune (T-cell failure), Cardiovascular (ion pump failure), Autonomic (catecholamine deficit). Each box shows 'SHOULD:' vs 'ACTUALLY:' comparison. Label: 'Every ATP-dependent system fails.'

Include intervention sidebar with blue (beneficial), yellow (caution), purple (experimental) boxes."

### Caption Text

"Oxidative stress in ME/CFS: normal handling vs pathological vicious cycle. **Top panel (green)**: Normal ROS handling—small amounts of ROS from metabolism are efficiently neutralized by glutathione, catalase, and other antioxidants, maintaining redox homeostasis. **Middle panel (red)**: ME/CFS reality—excessive ROS generation from dysfunctional Complex I/III overwhelms depleted antioxidant defenses. **Bottom panel (dark red)**: The PATHOLOGICAL vicious cycle that should not exist—oxidative damage impairs mitochondria, which leak more electrons, generating more ROS, causing more damage. This self-perpetuating cycle also corrupts catecholamine synthesis (via BH4 oxidation), Krebs cycle function (via aconitase destruction), and membrane integrity (via lipid peroxidation). Breaking this cycle requires replenishing depleted antioxidants while avoiding pro-oxidant supplements."

### Generation Prompt for AI Image Models

"Create a three-panel scientific diagram showing oxidative stress handling:

**Panel 1 (GREEN, labeled 'NORMAL')**: Show low ROS production from healthy mitochondria, efficiently neutralized by antioxidant shield (glutathione, SOD, catalase, vitamins C & E). Result: 'Redox homeostasis maintained.' Clean, balanced, healthy appearance.

**Panel 2 (RED, labeled 'ME/CFS REALITY')**: Same pathway but with excessive ROS arrows from damaged mitochondria, antioxidant defenses shown depleted/overwhelmed (red X marks on glutathione, vitamins). Result: 'ROS not fully neutralized - damage accumulates.'

**Panel 3 (DARK RED, labeled 'PATHOLOGICAL VICIOUS CYCLE')**: Circular diagram showing: Mitochondrial dysfunction → Electron leak → ROS generation → Oxidative damage → More mitochondrial dysfunction (back to start). Label prominently: 'THIS CYCLE SHOULD NOT EXIST.' Add three boxes showing corruption of: (1) Catecholamine synthesis via BH4 oxidation, (2) Krebs cycle via aconitase destruction, (3) Membranes via lipid peroxidation.

Include nitrosative stress branch showing NO + Superoxide → Peroxynitrite → damage."

### Caption Text

"Catecholamine synthesis and autonomic cascade: normal vs ME/CFS. **Top panel (green)**: Normal synthesis—tyrosine is efficiently converted to L-DOPA, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine via enzymes requiring BH4 and other cofactors, providing adequate neurotransmitters for motor function, motivation, arousal, and autonomic control. **Middle panel (red)**: ME/CFS reality—BH4 is depleted (oxidized to BH2 by peroxynitrite from oxidative stress), blocking the rate-limiting tyrosine hydroxylase step. CSF metabolite studies confirm reduced dopamine and norepinephrine production. **Bottom panel (dark red)**: The PATHOLOGICAL cascade—catecholamine deficiency causes parallel dopaminergic dysfunction (motor slowing, anhedonia) and noradrenergic dysfunction (fatigue, attention deficits, autonomic failure), converging on POTS, cerebral hypoperfusion, and cognitive dysfunction. This explains WHY brain fog worsens with standing."

## Figure 4: Tryptophan Pathway Diversion (Kynurenine Trap)

### Filename
`fig-tryptophan-kynurenine-pathway.pdf` / `.tikz`

### Target Chapter
`ch08-neurological.tex`

### Purpose
Show how inflammation PATHOLOGICALLY activates IDO, diverting tryptophan away from serotonin toward neurotoxic metabolites—a process that should not occur at this magnitude.

### Caption Text

"Tryptophan metabolism: normal vs the ME/CFS 'kynurenine trap.' **Top panel (green)**: Normal metabolism—~5% of tryptophan goes to serotonin/melatonin synthesis (small but critical), while ~95% goes through kynurenine pathway with balanced metabolites. IDO activity is LOW in healthy state. **Middle panel (red)**: ME/CFS reality—chronic inflammation (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6) PATHOLOGICALLY activates IDO, diverting tryptophan away from serotonin toward kynurenine. The KYN/TRP ratio is elevated. **Bottom panel (dark red)**: The dual problem that SHOULD NOT occur—simultaneous serotonin DEPLETION (mood, pain, sleep disruption) AND quinolinic acid ACCUMULATION (NMDA excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation). This is why it's called a 'trap': inflammation creates both deficiency and toxicity at once. Warning: Naive interventions (SSRIs, tryptophan supplements) may be ineffective or harmful. Address underlying inflammation instead."

"Post-exertional malaise: normal recovery vs ME/CFS crash. **Top panel (green)**: Normal exercise recovery—fatigue resolves within 24-48 hours via established physiological processes (lactate clearance, glycogen resynthesis, repair), potentially leading to improved fitness. This is why exercise benefits healthy people. **Middle panel (red)**: ME/CFS reality—a characteristic 12-48 hour DELAY before symptoms appear (patient may 'feel fine' initially), then multi-system crash. Two-day CPET studies show OBJECTIVE deterioration (VO₂peak ↓5.3%, work output ↓5.5%) 24 hours post-exertion—the OPPOSITE of healthy controls. **Bottom panel (dark red)**: The PATHOLOGICAL crash that SHOULD NOT occur—ATP crisis triggers ion pump failure, metabolite accumulation, and calcium dysregulation, causing simultaneous muscle, cognitive, immune, and autonomic symptoms. Recovery averages ~13 days (vs ~2 days in controls). DANGER: Repeated crashes before recovery can permanently worsen baseline. PACING (staying within energy envelope) is the primary evidence-based intervention."

## Figure 6: Cerebral Hypoperfusion & Cognitive Domains

**Plain-language title:** "Why Your Brain Feels Like It's Running on Low Power"

### Filename
`fig-cerebral-perfusion-cognition.pdf` / `.tikz`

### Target Chapter
`ch08-neurological.tex`

### Purpose
Show how autonomic dysfunction leads to reduced blood flow to the brain, and how this affects specific cognitive functions that patients experience as "brain fog."

### Key Terms for This Figure (Include in Glossary Box)
- **Cerebral blood flow**: The amount of blood reaching your brain each minute
- **Hypoperfusion**: Reduced blood flow - like trying to run a computer on a weak power supply
- **Autonomic nervous system**: Your body's "autopilot" for heart rate, blood pressure, digestion
- **POTS**: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome - heart races when standing because blood pressure control fails
- **Prefrontal cortex**: Brain region for planning, attention, working memory - the "executive control center"
- **Executive function**: Mental skills for planning, focusing, remembering instructions, multitasking
- **Temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)**: Brain region that calculates how much effort a task requires

│  WHY "BRAIN FOG" HAPPENS:                                                  │
│  Your brain is literally not getting enough blood. It's like trying to     │
│  run a computer on a weak power supply - everything slows down, crashes,  │
│  or won't start at all.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  WHY IT'S WORSE WHEN STANDING:                                             │
│  Your autonomic system can't compensate for gravity. When you stand,       │
│  blood pools in your legs instead of going to your brain. Lying down      │
│  immediately improves brain blood flow.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  WHY EVERYTHING FEELS SO HARD (TPJ explanation):                           │
│  Your brain has a region that calculates "is this task worth the effort?" │
│  When underpowered, it miscalculates everything as "too hard." This is    │
│  NOT laziness - it's a brain region making wrong calculations because     │
│  it doesn't have enough energy to work properly.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  WHAT HELPS:                                                               │
│  • Lie down when thinking is hard - gravity helps blood reach brain       │
│  • Salt and fluids (if doctor approves) - more blood volume               │
│  • Compression garments - prevent blood pooling in legs                    │
│  • Cognitive pacing - your brain needs rest just like your body           │
│                                                                             │
│  THE BOTTOM LINE:                                                          │
│  Your cognitive problems are real and have a physical cause: not enough   │
│  blood reaching your brain. This can be measured. You are not imagining   │
│  it, and you are not "just anxious" or "depressed."                        │
│                                                                             │

### Caption Text

**Plain-language caption:**
"Why brain fog happens in ME/CFS. Your autonomic nervous system (the body's 'autopilot') is supposed to keep blood flowing to your brain regardless of position. In ME/CFS, this system is broken—blood pools in your legs when you stand, and overall blood flow to the brain is reduced by 10-20%. Each brain region that doesn't get enough blood fails in predictable ways: the planning center can't plan, the memory center can't remember, the processing center slows down. Importantly, the region that calculates effort (TPJ) miscalculates everything as 'too hard'—this is why tasks feel impossible, and it's NOT laziness. The brain is protecting itself from perceived excessive demand."

## Figure 7: Immune Clearance Failure Loop

**Plain-language title:** "Why Your Immune System Can't Finish the Fight (And Gets Stuck in Overdrive)"

### Filename
`fig-immune-clearance-failure-loop.pdf` / `.tikz`

### Target Chapter
`ch08-neurological.tex` or dedicated immune chapter

### Purpose
Show how impaired immune cells fail to clear infections properly, leading to persistent triggers and chronic immune activation—a vicious cycle that perpetuates symptoms.

### Key Terms for This Figure (Include in Glossary Box)
- **NK cells (Natural Killer cells)**: Immune cells that destroy infected or abnormal cells - like security guards
- **T cells**: Immune cells that coordinate the immune response - like generals directing an army
- **Cytokines**: Signaling molecules immune cells use to communicate - like text messages between immune cells
- **Inflammation**: The immune system's response to threats - helpful short-term, harmful when chronic
- **Chronic activation**: When the immune system stays "on" all the time instead of turning off after fighting
- **Pathogen**: Anything that causes disease - viruses, bacteria, etc.
- **Autoimmunity**: When the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues

### What This Means For Patients

│  WHAT THIS MEANS FOR PATIENTS                                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                             │
│  WHY YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE FLU CONSTANTLY:                            │
│  Your immune system is stuck in "fight mode" but can't finish the fight.  │
│  The inflammation that's supposed to be temporary has become permanent.    │
│  The fatigue, achiness, and malaise are inflammatory symptoms.             │
│                                                                             │
│  WHY "BOOSTING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM" DOESN'T HELP:                           │
│  Your immune system isn't weak - it's OVERACTIVE but INEFFECTIVE.         │
│  It's like an army that's constantly mobilized but can't win the battle.  │
│  "Boosting" it just makes the inflammation worse.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  WHY YOU GOT SICK AFTER A VIRUS AND NEVER RECOVERED:                       │
│  Many ME/CFS cases start after an infection (like EBV, COVID, etc.)       │
│  Your immune system may not have fully cleared it, and now it's stuck     │
│  in the loop of trying to fight something it can't eliminate.              │
│                                                                             │
│  WHAT MIGHT HELP:                                                          │
│  • Treating any active infections (if found)                               │
│  • Reducing inflammation (diet, LDN, pacing)                               │
│  • NOT "immune boosting" supplements                                       │
│  • Experimental treatments targeting the specific immune problems          │
│                                                                             │
│  THE BOTTOM LINE:                                                          │
│  Your immune system is in a dysfunctional loop, not simply "weak."        │
│  Breaking the cycle requires addressing both the trigger (if present)      │
│  AND the immune dysfunction - not just "boosting" immunity.                │
│                                                                             │

## Figure 8: Master Integration - Metabolic-Immune-Autonomic Triad

**Plain-language title:** "How Three Broken Systems Keep Each Other Broken"

### Filename
`fig-master-integration-triad.pdf` / `.tikz`

### Target Chapter
Front matter or ch06 (central integrative figure)

### Purpose
Show the BIG PICTURE: how the three major dysfunction domains (Energy/Metabolism, Immune, Autonomic) interact with and reinforce each other, creating a self-perpetuating disease state. This explains why single treatments often fail.

### Key Terms for This Figure (Include in Glossary Box)
- **Triad**: Three interconnected systems that affect each other
- **Bidirectional**: Effects go both ways between systems (A affects B AND B affects A)
- **Self-perpetuating**: A system that keeps itself going once started
- **Convergence**: When multiple problems come together to cause something worse than any single problem

│  WHY YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS:                                  │
│  You don't have 20 different diseases. You have dysfunction in three       │
│  interconnected systems, each causing its own symptoms AND making the      │
│  other systems worse.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  WHY THAT SUPPLEMENT/MEDICATION "DIDN'T WORK":                             │
│  Single treatments target one system but leave the others broken.          │
│  The untreated systems keep dragging down the one you treated.             │
│  It's like fixing one leg of a three-legged stool.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  WHY PACING IS SO IMPORTANT:                                               │
│  Exceeding your limits crashes ALL THREE systems at once.                  │
│  Pacing is the only intervention that protects all three simultaneously.   │
│                                                                             │
│  WHY RECOVERY IS SO SLOW:                                                  │
│  Three systems have to recover, not one. And they keep interfering with    │
│  each other's recovery. It's not that you're not trying hard enough.       │
│                                                                             │
│  WHAT HELPS:                                                               │
│  • Foundation: Pacing, sleep, stress management (protects all 3)          │
│  • Layer in support for each system gradually                              │
│  • Expect incremental improvement, not dramatic cure                       │
│  • Address all three domains, not just one                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  THE BOTTOM LINE:                                                          │
│  ME/CFS is a disease of interconnected system failures. Understanding      │
│  this helps you understand why treatment is complex and why progress       │
│  is often slow - but also provides a framework for comprehensive           │
│  management that addresses the whole picture.                              │
│                                                                             │

### Caption Text

**Plain-language caption:**
"ME/CFS as a triad of interconnected dysfunctions. Energy production (metabolism), immune function, and autonomic control are all broken—and they keep making each other worse. Damaged mitochondria can't provide enough energy for immune cells to function OR for the autonomic system to regulate properly. Chronic inflammation damages mitochondria further. Poor autonomic control reduces blood flow, limiting oxygen to mitochondria. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) emerges when all three systems crash together. This is why single treatments often fail: fixing one system while the others remain broken provides limited benefit. Comprehensive management must address all three domains, with pacing as the foundation that protects all systems from crash-inducing overexertion."

## Implementation Notes

### Key Principle: THREE-ZONE Structure

Every figure must clearly show:

1. **NORMAL (Green)**: What SHOULD happen in healthy physiology
   - Label clearly: "Normal" / "Healthy" / "Should"
   - Show the process working correctly
   - Emphasize this is how it SHOULD work

2. **ME/CFS REALITY (Red)**: What ACTUALLY happens
   - Label clearly: "ME/CFS" / "Actual" / "Impaired"
   - Show same process with failure points marked
   - Use ✗ symbols at impairment locations
   - Include evidence boxes with citations

3. **PATHOLOGICAL PROCESS (Dark Red)**: Abnormal processes/cascades
   - Label clearly: "Pathological" / "Vicious Cycle" / "Should NOT Exist"
   - Show self-perpetuating cycles
   - Show how pathology CORRUPTS other normal processes
   - Emphasize these are DISEASE PROCESSES, not normal variation

### For Interventions

Always clarify:
- ✅ **Beneficial**: WHERE it acts, WHY it helps
- ⚠️ **Caution**: WHY it might harm, WHAT can go wrong
- 🔬 **Experimental**: Current STATUS, why not yet proven

### Generation Prompt Template

"Create a three-panel scientific diagram:

**Panel 1 (GREEN, top, labeled 'NORMAL - What SHOULD Happen')**: [Describe healthy process]

**Panel 2 (RED, middle, labeled 'ME/CFS - What ACTUALLY Happens')**: [Same process with red X markers at failure points, evidence callout boxes]

**Panel 3 (DARK RED, bottom, labeled 'PATHOLOGICAL - Should NOT Exist')**: [Show vicious cycles, corruption of other systems, self-perpetuation. Emphasize these are disease processes.]

Include intervention sidebar with clear categorization."
