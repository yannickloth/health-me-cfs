  # Validation Results
  validation:
    temporal_consistency:
      - "✓ All event latencies compatible with observed timelines"
      - "✓ Activity durations align with biomarker persistence"
      - "⚠ Feedback loop latency estimated from indirect evidence (needs prospective study)"

    probability_validation:
      - "✓ Recovery/chronic split (40%/60%) based on Jason2019 onset patterns"
      - "✓ Immune activation frequency (87%) matches Hornig2015 early-stage patients"
      - "⚠ Metabolic shift frequency (95%) inferred from Lim2020 meta-analysis (direct measurement would improve)"

    invariant_verification:
      - "✓ All global invariants maintained throughout model"
      - "✓ Event pre-/post-conditions consistent"
      - "✓ Activity resource consumption respects ATP ≥ 0 constraint"
      - "✓ Loop invariants mathematically consistent (exponential decay)"

    mechanistic_support:
      - "✓ E1→E2: Direct measurement in 2-day CPET studies (Lim2020, Keller2024)"
      - "✓ E2→E3: DAMPs mechanism demonstrated in vitro, correlation in patient data"
      - "⚠ E3→E4: Correlation strong but mechanism incompletely characterized"
      - "⚠ Feedback loop: Inferred from repeated episodes, needs longitudinal validation"

    missing_data:
      - "Exact threshold for E1 varies by individual (need personalized CPET)"
      - "Branching probability modifiers (age, genetics, severity) not quantified"
      - "Feedback loop breaking conditions not empirically tested"
      - "Temporal properties derivable from structure but need empirical validation studies"

    overall_assessment:
      certainty: 0.7
      main_pathway_certainty: 0.8
      feedback_loop_certainty: 0.6
      notes: "Model well-supported for main pathway E1→E2→E3→E4. Feedback loop component has medium certainty. Quantitative thresholds need personalization."
