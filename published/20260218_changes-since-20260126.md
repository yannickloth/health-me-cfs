# Changes since version 2026-01-26

## New chapters and sections

- **Chapter 15 (Symptom-Producing Mechanisms)** — new chapter (work in progress), with a supporting supplement added to Chapter 5. Approximately 50 new citations added alongside this chapter.
- **Chapter 25b (Proposed Studies)** — new chapter presenting a structured research agenda with detailed study designs.

## Substantially rewritten or expanded content

### Part 1 — Clinical

- **Chapter 2 (Core Symptoms)** — major expansion, including new content on wheat/gluten intolerance as a potential symptom amplifier, and updated symptom interaction models.
- **Chapter 4 (Diagnostic Criteria)** — comprehensive expansion: detailed comparison of ICC, CCC, IOM, and SEID criteria with sensitivity/specificity data, validation studies, and historical evolution.
- **Chapter 5 (Disease Course)** — multiple sections expanded:
  - New analysis of adult recovery potential with longitudinal evidence
  - New content on multi-hit onset cascades and vaccine-related onset
  - Expanded subgroup analysis: immune-predominant, neurological, and metabolic phenotypes with cluster analysis findings and clinical implications
- **Chapter 12 (Genetics and Epigenetics)** — complete rewrite with updated content throughout.

### Part 2 — Pathophysiology

- **Chapter 6 (Metabolism and Energy)** — new section integrating the selective energy dysfunction hypothesis.
- **Chapter 7 (Immune Dysfunction)** — new content on mast cell mechanisms, based on recent literature (small fiber neuropathy link, CADM1-mediated degranulation, circadian regulation of mast cells).
- **Chapter 8 (Neurological)** — new brain-centric pathophysiology model with cerebral blood flow evidence; seven previously uncited claims now supported with citations.
- **Chapter 10 (Cardiovascular)** — expanded hypovolemia analysis with a new figure (hypovolemia mechanisms); blood volume research synthesis.
- **Chapter 11 (Gut Microbiome)** — major expansion integrating recent gut-microbiome research.
- **Chapter 13 (Integrative Models)** — new vicious cycle network model with accompanying figure.
- **Chapter 14 (Speculative Hypotheses)** — new models added: exhausted immune surveillance, infection ratchet, developmental immunity and recovery hypotheses; refined selective energy dysfunction formalization; Wirth & Scheibenbogen neurotransmitter dysregulation framework integrated.
- **Pediatric topics** (across multiple chapters) — comprehensive quality audit with explicit certainty assessments added throughout; severe/bedbound patient mechanisms integrated across six chapters.

### Part 3 — Treatment

- **Chapter 14a (Severe ME/CFS — Urgent Action)** — expanded treatment protocols.
- **Chapter 14b (Mild/Moderate ME/CFS)** — expanded protocols; corrected severity distribution figures (mild revised from 50% to 25%; moderate from 25% to 50%).
- **Chapter 18 (Emerging Therapies)** — new content on vagal tone restoration and gut-brain axis interventions; mast cell treatment section.
- **Chapter 21 (Medications)** — major expansion with evidence-based protocols.
- **Chapter 24 (Symptom Management)** — large expansion including urgent action protocols and advanced pacing guidance.

### Part 4 — Research

- Translational findings chapter updated.
- Appendix J (Recommendations) significantly expanded.

## New figures

- Gut microbiome to mitochondria cascade diagram
- Hypovolemia mechanisms diagram
- Vicious cycle network model diagram

## Scientific quality improvements

- ~75 new citations added across mechanism, clinical, and treatment domains (including 6 critical priority citations and 17 mechanism/clinical citations from a quality review pass).
- Severity distribution statistics corrected in Chapter 14b.
- Uncited claims resolved across Chapters 8 and 14b following a scientific rigor audit.
