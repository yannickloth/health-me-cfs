    eosinophilic_cationic_protein:
      value: 30.20
      unit: "µg/l"
      reference: "<15.00"
      interpretation: "ELEVATED"
      clinical_note: "2x upper limit - suggests eosinophilic inflammation"

clinical_summary:
  primary_findings:
    - "Elevated ECP indicating eosinophilic activation"
    - "Suggests ongoing type 2 inflammation post-COVID"

  relevance: |
    Elevated ECP in post-COVID context may indicate:
    - Persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation
    - Mast cell/eosinophil cross-activation (common in MCAS)
    - Type 2 immune skewing post-viral infection
