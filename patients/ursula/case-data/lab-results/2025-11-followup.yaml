clinical_summary:
  primary_findings:
    - "NK cells now measurably low (6.89%) - impaired viral surveillance"
    - "Iron/ferritin elevated - possible inflammation or iron overload"
    - "EBV titers decreasing but still extremely elevated"
    - "Lipid profile slightly improved"
    - "Lymphocyte count still low, T-cells still elevated"

  trend_analysis: |
    Comparing Jan 2025 to Nov 2025:
    - EBV IgG: 596 → 514 E/ml (14% decrease)
    - EBV EBNA: 213 → 156 E/ml (27% decrease)
    - Cholesterol: 286 → 258 mg/dl (10% decrease)
    - Triglycerides: 278 → 247 mg/dl (11% decrease)
    - Lymphocytes: 19% → 21% (slight improvement)

    New finding: NK cell measurement reveals impaired viral surveillance,
    explaining persistent high EBV titers despite antibody production.

  iron_interpretation: |
    Elevated iron and ferritin in context of:
    - Chronic inflammation (ferritin as acute phase reactant)
    - Possible hemochromatosis gene variants (not tested)
    - Reduced erythropoiesis from chronic disease
    Needs: Transferrin saturation, TIBC to differentiate
