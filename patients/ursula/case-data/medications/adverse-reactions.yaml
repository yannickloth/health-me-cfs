# CRITICAL: This patient identifies as a "paradoxical reactor"
# Start all new medications at fraction of standard dose

patient_phenotype:
  paradoxical_reactor: true
  description: |
    Patient experiences paradoxical (opposite of expected) reactions to multiple
    medications. Standard doses often cause severe adverse effects. Requires
    careful titration starting at micro-doses.

documented_adverse_reactions:
  - medication: "LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone)"
    reaction_type: "psychiatric"
    symptoms:
      - "Depression"
      - "Suicidal ideation"
    severity: "SEVERE"
    onset: "Not specified"
    outcome: "Required discontinuation"
    clinical_significance: |
      LDN is generally well-tolerated but can cause mood changes.
      This severe psychiatric reaction is uncommon but documented.
      IMPORTANT: Screen for mood changes when starting LDN in ME/CFS patients.
    patient_quote: "LDN und auch Famotidin kann Depressionen und Suizidgedanken verursachen, war bei mir so."

  - medication: "Famotidine"
    reaction_type: "psychiatric"
    symptoms:
      - "Depression"
      - "Suicidal ideation"
    severity: "SEVERE"
    onset: "Not specified"
    clinical_significance: |
      H2 blockers can rarely cause CNS effects including depression.
      Famotidine crosses blood-brain barrier less than cimetidine but
      psychiatric effects still possible.
      NOTE: Patient tolerates Cimetidine well despite Famotidine reaction -
      may be drug-specific rather than class effect.

  - medication: "Low-dose Prednisolone"
    reaction_type: "psychiatric"
    symptoms:
      - "Hypermania"
      - "Psychotic states"
    severity: "SEVERE"
    onset: "During treatment for pain"
    context: "Used temporarily for pain management"
    clinical_significance: |
      Corticosteroid-induced psychiatric effects are well-documented.
      More common at higher doses but can occur at low doses in susceptible individuals.
      Paradoxical reactors may be at higher risk.
    patient_quote: "niedrig dosiertes Prednisolon... hatte dann Hypermanie und psychotische Zustände"

  - medication: "Mestinon (Pyridostigmine) 60mg"
    reaction_type: "somatic"
    symptoms:
      - "Severe symptoms requiring bed rest"
    severity: "MODERATE-SEVERE"
    dose_threshold: "60 mg (standard starting dose)"
    tolerated_dose: "20 mg"
    clinical_significance: |
      ME/CFS patients often require 1/4 to 1/3 of standard doses.
      This is not a true adverse reaction but demonstrates
      extreme sensitivity requiring dose adjustment.
    patient_quote: "Bei 60 mg lag ich scheppernd im Bett"

medication_safety_protocol:
  general_approach:
    - "Start ALL new medications at 1/4 to 1/10 standard dose"
    - "Titrate slowly with minimum 1-week intervals"
    - "Monitor closely for paradoxical/psychiatric reactions"
    - "Have discontinuation plan ready"
    - "Prefer medications patient has previously tolerated"

  mood_monitoring:
    required_for:
      - "LDN"
      - "Famotidine"
      - "Any H2 blocker"
      - "Corticosteroids"
      - "LDA/Aripiprazole"
    protocol: |
      Daily mood check for first 2 weeks:
      - PHQ-2 screening questions
      - Family/caregiver observation
      - Immediate discontinuation if suicidal ideation
      - Consider safer alternatives

  drug_class_notes:
    h2_blockers: |
      Patient tolerated Cimetidine but not Famotidine.
      Consider Cimetidine as first-line H2 blocker.
      Note: Cimetidine has more drug interactions (CYP450 inhibition).

    opioids: |
      Not documented but caution advised:
      - Many opioids release histamine
      - Patient has histamine intolerance
      - May cause paradoxical reactions

    benzodiazepines: |
      Not documented. If needed:
      - Start at 1/4 dose
      - Monitor for paradoxical agitation
      - Short-term use only

    ssris_snris: |
      Not documented. If antidepressant needed:
      - Start at micro-doses
      - Monitor closely for activation/agitation
      - Consider alternatives (mirtazapine may be better tolerated)

contraindicated_medications:
  - medication: "Aspirin"
    reason: "Histamine Intolerance (HIT)"
    mechanism: "Aspirin inhibits DAO and releases histamine"

  - medication: "NSAIDs (most)"
    reason: "Potential histamine release"
    exceptions: "May tolerate some better than others - test carefully"

warnings_for_similar_patients:
  key_message: |
    "Was die KI und viele nicht wissen: LDN und auch Famotidin kann
    Depressionen und Suizidgedanken verursachen... Das Low Dose Abilify
    ist auch nicht harmlos. Grade, wenn man paradox auf Medis reagiert."

    Translation: AI and many don't know that LDN and Famotidine can cause
    depression and suicidal thoughts. Low-dose Abilify is also not harmless,
    especially for those who react paradoxically to medications.

  implications:
    - "Screen for paradoxical reactor phenotype before starting ME/CFS medications"
    - "LDN is not universally safe - monitor mood"
    - "H2 blockers can cause psychiatric effects"
    - "Start low, go slow applies even for 'low-dose' protocols"
