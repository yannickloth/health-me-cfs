treatment_responses:
  excellent_responses:
    - treatment: "Cimetidine (Luc Biland Protocol)"
      response_level: "EXCELLENT"
      functional_improvement: "From bedbound to able to take short walks"
      patient_description: "got me out of bed"
      timeline: "Not specified"
      sustainability: "Planning to continue/restart"
      mechanism_hypothesis: |
        In context of extremely high EBV titers (596 E/ml) and
        B-cell depletion, cimetidine's immunomodulatory effect
        (enhancing cellular immunity via H2 blockade) may be
        particularly beneficial.

    - treatment: "Ivabradine"
      response_level: "GOOD"
      indication: "POTS"
      outcome: "POTS symptoms mitigated"

    - treatment: "Pacing (Lockdown period)"
      response_level: "GOOD"
      context: "COVID-19 lockdown 2020-2021"
      outcome: "Improvement noted"
      patient_insight: "Pacing? (patient questioning if this was the mechanism)"

  partial_responses:
    - treatment: "Mestinon 20mg"
      response_level: "EARLY/PARTIAL"
      status: "Recently started"
      observation: "Running well so far at low dose"
      note: "60mg not tolerated"

    - treatment: "Cerebokan (Ginkgo)"
      response_level: "PARTIAL"
      indication: "Concentration"
      note: "Helps with cognitive symptoms"

    - treatment: "LDA (Low-Dose Abilify)"
      response_level: "UNCERTAIN"
      indication: "Cognitive support"
      caution: "Patient notes it's 'not harmless' for paradoxical reactors"

  failed_treatments:
    - treatment: "LDN"
      outcome: "FAILED - Adverse reaction"
      reason: "Depression and suicidal ideation"

    - treatment: "Famotidine"
      outcome: "FAILED - Adverse reaction"
      reason: "Depression and suicidal ideation"

    - treatment: "Low-dose Prednisolone"
      outcome: "FAILED - Adverse reaction"
      reason: "Hypermania and psychotic states"

    - treatment: "Mestinon 60mg"
      outcome: "FAILED - Dose intolerance"
      reason: "Severe symptoms requiring bed rest"

  treatments_unable_to_try:
    - treatment: "Aspirin"
      reason: "Contraindicated in HIT"
      potential_benefit: |
        Patient notes aspirin would be useful for:
        - Neuroinflammation
        - Microclot management

historical_patterns:
  recovery_attempts:
    - period: "Post-2014 infection"
      outcome: "Never fully recovered but had better periods"
      pattern: "ME/CFS came in episodes (now recognized as PEM)"

    - period: "Lockdown 2020-2021"
      outcome: "Improvement"
      mechanism: "Possibly enforced pacing"

    - period: "Post-vaccine 2021"
      outcome: "Recovery from ER admission"
      note: "Did recover before COVID infections"

    - period: "Post-COVID 2023"
      outcome: "Months to recover, but did recover somewhat"

    - period: "Post-COVID 2024 + Influenza B 2025"
      outcome: "Body 'gave up' - bedbound since May 2025"
      note: "This time no recovery"

  key_insight: |
    Pattern suggests patient was never truly in remission but operating
    at minimal functional capacity. Each viral hit depleted remaining
    reserves until complete collapse. The "recoveries" were likely
    periods of marginal functionality, not true recovery of underlying
    dysfunction.

cimetidine_responder_phenotype:
  supporting_features:
    - "Extremely high EBV titers (596 E/ml)"
    - "B-cell depletion (possible exhaustion from chronic viral stimulation)"
    - "MCAS features"
    - "Post-infectious onset pattern"

  mechanism_alignment: |
    Cimetidine enhances cellular immunity (T-cells, NK cells) via H2 blockade.
    In patient with:
    - Depleted B-cells (antibody-based defense compromised)
    - Low NK cells (viral surveillance impaired)
    - Extremely high EBV (suggesting failed viral control)

    ...enhancing cellular immunity may address the specific deficit.

  research_implication: |
    Could the combination of high EBV + low B-cells + low NK cells
    predict cimetidine response? This pattern suggests "exhausted
    immune surveillance" where immunomodulation (not immunosuppression)
    is needed.
