# Multi-Hit Cascade Pattern
# This timeline illustrates cumulative immune/autonomic burden leading to ME/CFS

timeline:
  - year: 2012
    event: "Interstitial Cystitis onset"
    category: "initial_inflammatory"
    significance: |
      Earliest documented inflammatory condition.
      IC involves mast cell activation, bladder inflammation.
      May represent baseline immune vulnerability/dysregulation.

  - year: 2014
    event: "Severe infection during extremely stressful period"
    category: "triggering_infection"
    outcome: "Never fully recovered"
    patient_description: "wurde nie wieder richtig gesund"
    significance: |
      First major hit. Combination of infection + stress likely
      overwhelmed compensatory capacity. Classic post-infectious
      onset pattern but with pre-existing IC.

  - year: 2015
    event: "Fibromyalgia diagnosis"
    category: "spreading_sensitization"
    significance: |
      Central sensitization now manifest. Widespread pain indicates
      CNS involvement. Patient trajectory: localized (IC) → systemic
      (post-infection) → centralized (fibromyalgia).

  - year: 2015-2020
    period: "Intermittent better periods"
    category: "unstable_remission"
    pattern: "ME/CFS came in episodes"
    patient_insight: "Heute weiß ich, das war PEM"
    significance: |
      Patient retrospectively recognizes episodic pattern as PEM.
      This was NOT true remission but oscillation between
      minimal functionality and crashes. "Recoveries" were periods
      of marginal operation, not resolution of underlying dysfunction.

  - year: 2020-2021
    period: "COVID-19 lockdown"
    category: "improvement"
    outcome: "Improvement"
    patient_hypothesis: "Pacing?"
    significance: |
      Enforced rest during lockdown may have allowed some recovery.
      Validates pacing as therapeutic but also shows how much
      baseline activity was exceeding energy envelope.

  - year: 2021
    event: "BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination"
    category: "vaccination_adverse_events"
    reactions:
      - "Facial paralysis (facialis paresis) - both doses"
      - "Vision loss (-3 diopters)"
      - "Numb left thigh with extreme nerve pain"
      - "Menopause onset"
      - "ER admission"
    outcome: "Eventually recovered from acute events"
    significance: |
      Multiple adverse reactions suggest underlying immune/neural
      vulnerability. Facial paralysis (Bell's palsy-like) indicates
      cranial nerve involvement. Vision loss suggests optic nerve
      or retinal impact. These are significant neurological events.

  - year: 2022
    event: "ME/CFS formal diagnosis"
    category: "diagnosis"
    significance: "Finally received correct diagnosis after years of symptoms"

  - year: 2023
    event: "COVID-19 infection"
    category: "viral_hit"
    outcome: "Months to recover"
    significance: |
      Despite vaccination adverse events, actual COVID infection
      caused severe illness requiring months of recovery.
      Shows disease itself poses significant risk.

  - year: 2024
    event: "COVID-19 infection (Fall 2024)"
    category: "viral_hit"
    outcome: "Severe pain returned"
    patient_description: "die Höllenschmerzen wieder da"
    significance: "Second COVID infection - accumulating damage"

  - year: 2025
    month: "Spring"
    event: "Influenza B infection"
    category: "viral_hit"
    significance: "Additional viral hit on already compromised system"

  - year: 2025
    date: "May 1"
    event: "Last outing (May Day march)"
    category: "collapse_trigger"
    significance: "Patient can pinpoint last day of functionality"

  - year: 2025
    period: "May onwards"
    event: "Bedbound"
    category: "severe_phase"
    status: "Requires rest and darkening"
    current_state: |
      Light sensitivity, severe fatigue, cognitive dysfunction ("teils wie dement")
      Short walks possible on good days (thanks to Cimetidine)
    patient_description: "mein Körper hat aufgegeben"

multi_hit_analysis:
  total_hits: 7
  hit_sequence:
    1: "IC 2012 - Baseline inflammatory state"
    2: "2014 infection + stress - Post-infectious syndrome"
    3: "2021 vaccination - Multiple neurological adverse events"
    4: "2023 COVID - Months to recover"
    5: "2024 COVID - Return of severe pain"
    6: "2025 Influenza B - Additional viral load"
    7: "May 2025 activity - Final collapse trigger"

  pattern_recognition: |
    Classic multi-hit model with:
    - Pre-existing inflammatory condition (IC)
    - Triggering infection during stress
    - Spreading sensitization (fibromyalgia)
    - Additional immune challenges (vaccination, COVID, flu)
    - Progressive decompensation with each hit
    - Final collapse following cumulative burden

  false_recovery_hypothesis: |
    CRITICAL INSIGHT: Patient was likely never truly recovered.

    The "better periods" represent:
    - Minimal functional capacity (not healthy baseline)
    - Operating within reduced energy envelope
    - Any additional stressor reveals underlying dysfunction

    Evidence:
    - "ME/CFS came in episodes" → actually PEM cycles
    - "Lockdown improvement" → enforced pacing, not healing
    - "Recovered after vaccine" → returned to minimal baseline
    - "Recovered after 2023 COVID" → months of struggle, not true recovery

    Each viral hit didn't "cause ME/CFS again" - it revealed and worsened
    the underlying dysfunction that was never resolved. The "recoveries"
    were precarious minimal functionality that collapsed under any
    significant immune challenge.

immune_trajectory:
  - phase: "Pre-2014"
    immune_status: "Vulnerable but compensated"
    evidence: "IC indicates baseline mast cell/immune dysregulation"

  - phase: "2014-2020"
    immune_status: "Chronic dysfunction, marginally functional"
    evidence: "Episodic crashes (PEM), fibromyalgia development"

  - phase: "2021"
    immune_status: "Challenged by vaccination"
    evidence: "Multiple neurological adverse events"

  - phase: "2023-2025"
    immune_status: "Progressive decompensation"
    evidence: "Each infection causes worse/longer recovery"

  - phase: "May 2025-present"
    immune_status: "Exhausted"
    evidence: |
      Lab findings: B-cells depleted, NK cells low, T-cells elevated
      EBV extremely high despite antibody production
      "Exhausted immune surveillance" phenotype

research_implications:
  - "Multi-hit model validation with detailed timeline"
  - "False recovery pattern documentation (precarious minimal functionality)"
  - "Vaccination as additional hit in vulnerable individuals"
  - "Progressive immune exhaustion measurable via serial labs"
  - "Cimetidine response in late-stage exhausted phenotype"
