## Notes

- Patient is based in Austria (Vienna) - MedUni Wien off-label list relevant
- Patient shows severe ME/CFS (bedbound) with significant response to cimetidine + amino acids
- Identified as potential exemplar case for viral-immune-metabolic cluster subtype
- Privacy protection required for any case study publication
- Gender correction: Patient is female (Ursula)

## Next Steps

1. **Chapter Integration** - Use chapter-integrator agent to add content to main chapters
2. **Phenotype Section** - Create Cimetidine-Responder phenotype in ch05-subgroups.tex
3. **Causal Diagrams** - TikZ illustrations for mechanism pathways
4. **Case Study** - Formal documentation of patient as exemplar case
