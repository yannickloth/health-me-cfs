  POST-RITALIN RESPONSE - POTENTIAL REBOUND SYMPTOMS

  Timeline:
  - Monday 2026-02-10: Ritalin MR 30mg x1 → Excellent response (energy 6/10, cognitive 8)
  - Tuesday 2026-02-10: No Ritalin MR → Weakness + tremors + excessive sleep

  Current Tuesday presentation:
  - Sleep: Excessive (1.5h morning + 2.5-3h afternoon, woke at 15:00)
  - Weakness: Generalized with tremors
  - Tremor character: "Similar to hypoglycemia"
  - Energy: Very low (2/10)
  - Cognitive: Minimal (3/10)

  Clinical interpretation:

  HYPOTHESIS 1: Post-stimulant rebound
  - Stimulant medication on Monday "borrowed" energy/alertness
  - Tuesday = energy debt payoff
  - Explains: excessive sleep + weakness + tremors
  - Mechanism: CNS upregulation after stimulant withdrawal

  HYPOTHESIS 2: Hypoglycemic-like metabolic crash
  - Stimulant may have increased glucose utilization on Monday
  - Tuesday: metabolic exhaustion manifesting as hypoglycemic-like symptoms
  - Tremors suggest sympathetic activation (as in hypoglycemia)
  - Weakness suggests ATP depletion
  - Excessive sleep = energy recovery mechanism

  HYPOTHESIS 3: Post-exertional sensitivity rebound
  - Monday's stimulant use enabled activity/mental engagement
  - Now observing delayed PEM/metabolic consequences
  - Would not be just post-stimulant; would be post-effort PEM
  - Hypoglycemic tremors may be coincidental symptom

  KEY OBSERVATION FOR RITALIN PROTOCOL:
  - If this is rebound → need careful titration strategy
  - If this is metabolic debt → need to address underlying energy deficit
  - If this is PEM → need to track activity level on Monday (was energy increase just subjective?)

  CRITICAL QUESTION:
  - Did Monday have genuine functional improvement (could do more) or just subjective "felt better"?
  - If genuine improvement with actual increased activity → explains Tuesday as PEM
  - If just subjective without behavior change → explains Tuesday as rebound

  Recommended next steps:
  1. Check actual activity level on Monday (did Ritalin enable more doing?)
  2. Monitor Wednesday with and without Ritalin
  3. Consider dose timing effects (morning vs. other times)
  4. Evaluate whether hypoglycemic-like state responds to food/glucose

  MEDICAL SAFETY NOTE:
  - Hypoglycemic-like tremors warrant checking actual blood glucose if possible
  - Could also represent dysautonomia (Ritalin affects BP/HR)
  - Should discuss with physician before next Ritalin trial
