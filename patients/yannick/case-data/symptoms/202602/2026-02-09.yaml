  ACTIVITY-TRIGGERED PEM EPISODE

  Timeline:
  - Saturday 2026-02-08: Continued household work despite pain (6/10) and low energy (4/10)
  - Sunday 2026-02-09 morning: Crash onset, severity 8/10
  - Sunday 2026-02-09 afternoon: Resolved to acceptable state after ~7 hours

  Characteristics:
  - Rapid onset (next morning after activity)
  - Severe but short-duration crash
  - Complete resolution within 7 hours (unusual for PEM; suggests possible post-exertional dip rather than classic PEM)
  - Or: May have been in early recovery phase by afternoon recording

  Clinical interpretation:
  - Clear temporal relationship: overactivity on Saturday → crash on Sunday morning
  - Short duration (7 hours) vs typical PEM (days) suggests either:
    1) Mild-to-moderate PEM with rapid recovery trajectory
    2) Post-exertional dip (not meeting full PEM criteria)
    3) Recording time may have been late in recovery

  Relevant context for Monday Ritalin trial: This recovery day appears to be when Ritalin MR was first taken.
