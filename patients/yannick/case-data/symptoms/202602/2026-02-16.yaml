meals:
  breakfast:
    - to be filled in

sleep:
  quality: to be filled in
  notes: to be filled in

activity:
  morning:
    - status: minimal activity reported
      notes: patient reported feeling tired from morning

  evening:
    - status: extremely tired
      action_taken: needed to rest
      note: severe fatigue requiring rest, tinnitus onset during this period

symptoms:
  energy:
    morning_status: tired
    current_status: "really tired"
    severity: "strong tiredness"
    timing: "from the morning"
    progression: feeling like should sleep (reported mid-morning)
    overall_assessment: Day 2 post-Feb 15 headache - significant fatigue continuing
    notes: |
      Tiredness progressing through morning. Patient reports "really tired" with "strong tiredness."
      This is continuation of symptoms from Feb 15 (huge headache + "everything was hard work").

  cognitive_function:
    status: moderately impaired
    self_assessment: "6-7/10"
    notes: |
      Cognitive function rated 6-7/10 (presumably 10 = best functioning).
      This represents MODERATE impairment - not severe but clearly below baseline.

      Combined with "strong tiredness," indicates both physical and cognitive systems affected.

      This is different from Feb 13 pattern where "head is OK" despite physical fatigue.
      Today shows cognitive impact, suggesting CNS involvement (consistent with yesterday's headache).

  sinus_ear_symptoms:
    stuffed_nose:
      status: improved but not completely resolved
      description: "not completely free, but without yesterday's pain"
      progression: pain resolved, congestion persisting but better

    sinus_pain:
      status: resolved
      note: no sinus pain today (was present yesterday)

    left_ear_pain:
      status: resolved
      note: no left ear pain today (was present yesterday with Eustachian tube involvement)

    tinnitus:
      onset: Sunday evening (Feb 16)
      location: both ears
      context: appeared in evening when "extremely tired and needed to rest"
      clinical_significance: |
        New symptom - tinnitus in BOTH ears (vs left ear pain yesterday).

        Tinnitus can indicate:
        1. **Eustachian tube dysfunction recovery**: After acute inflammation resolves, tube
           pressure/function normalization can cause temporary tinnitus
        2. **ME/CFS/fatigue symptom**: Tinnitus common during severe fatigue states
        3. **Residual inflammation**: Middle ear/Eustachian tube still recovering
        4. **Both ears affected**: Suggests systemic rather than local cause

        Timing with "extremely tired" suggests fatigue-related component.

    overall_pattern: |
      **Improvement from Feb 15 to Feb 16:**
      - Sinus pain: RESOLVED ✓
      - Left ear pain: RESOLVED ✓
      - Stuffed nose: IMPROVED (still present but less severe, no pain)
      - NEW: Tinnitus both ears (evening onset)

      This pattern suggests:
      - Acute sinus/ear inflammation is RESOLVING (pain gone)
      - Residual congestion/dysfunction persisting but improving
      - Tinnitus may be related to Eustachian tube recovery OR severe fatigue state

      Overall: Sinus/infection component appears to be improving, leaving primarily PEM symptoms
      (strong tiredness, cognitive impairment, extreme evening fatigue)

interpretation: |
  DELAYED PEM FROM FEB 14 ACTIVITIES - CONTINUING (Day 2 of secondary crash)

  **CONFIRMED TIMELINE:**

  - **Feb 14 (Day 3 post-crash)**: Substantial activity load (>2h standing, groceries, cooking, haircut, coding)
    - Evening: Felt "OK", "generally good day", no strong tiredness
    - No headache, no cognitive symptoms during or after activities

  - **Feb 15 (Day 4, 24h post-activity)**: **HUGE HEADACHE THE WHOLE DAY** + sinus/ear symptoms
    - Patient confirms: "Did feel like PEM"
    - "Everything was hard work" (classic PEM - even minimal tasks difficult)
    - Also: Stuffed nose, sinus pain, left ear/Eustachian tube pain
    - Patient took same supplements as today (LCAR, CoQ10, NAD+, Cetirizine, LDN 3mg)
    - **Combination crash**: PEM + sinus/upper respiratory inflammation

  - **Feb 16 (Day 5, 48h post-activity - TODAY)**: Continuing symptoms
    - Morning: Tired "from the morning"
    - Current status: "Really tired", "strong tiredness"
    - Cognitive function: 6-7/10 (moderately impaired)
    - Progression: "I feel like I should sleep"
    - PEM symptoms continuing from Feb 15 crash
    - Sinus/ear symptoms status: not yet reported (need to check if still present)

  **CRITICAL INTERPRETATION:**

  This is CLASSIC ME/CFS delayed PEM pattern - patient felt capable on Feb 14, performed activities,
  then crashed 24h later with severe headache. Now continuing into Day 2 with fatigue/sleepiness.

  **Feb 14's "remarkable recovery" was FALSE IMPRESSION:**
  - Ability to perform >2h standing on Day 3 post-crash did NOT indicate true recovery
  - Patient was still physiologically vulnerable
  - Activities exceeded true energy envelope despite feeling OK
  - 24h delayed headache proves Feb 14 activity load was too much

  **COMPOUNDED CRASH - TWO OVERLAPPING PEM CYCLES:**

  1. **Primary crash** (Feb 12 trigger → Feb 13 peak):
     - Physical/autonomic symptoms (weakness, extreme sleepiness, ear pain)
     - Cognitive preserved (no headache, no brain fog)

  2. **Secondary crash** (Feb 14 activities → Feb 15 peak):
     - Cognitive/CNS symptoms (HUGE headache all day)
     - Triggered by activity during recovery window of primary crash
     - Different symptom pattern (headache vs weakness) suggests CNS impact

  **CURRENT STATUS (Feb 16):**

  Patient is experiencing:
  - **Strong tiredness**: "Really tired", described as "strong tiredness"
  - **Cognitive impairment**: 6-7/10 (moderately impaired - below baseline)
  - **Progression**: Morning tiredness → "I feel like I should sleep"
  - **Body demanding rest/recovery time**

  This represents Day 2 of secondary crash continuation. Combined physical fatigue + cognitive
  impairment indicates both systems affected (different from Feb 13 where cognitive was preserved).

  Symptoms should gradually improve over next 3-7 days IF strict rest maintained. However,
  compounded crashes (activity during recovery from previous crash) can extend recovery time and
  increase E5b (chronic baseline reduction) risk.

  **Sinus/ear symptoms progression - IMPROVING:**

  Comparison Feb 15 → Feb 16:
  - Sinus pain: YES → NO (resolved)
  - Left ear pain: YES → NO (resolved)
  - Stuffed nose: YES with pain → IMPROVED (less congestion, no pain)
  - Tinnitus: NO → YES (both ears, evening onset)

  **Clinical interpretation:**
  Acute sinus/ear inflammation is RESOLVING. Pain symptoms have resolved, residual congestion
  improving. New tinnitus (both ears, evening) may indicate:
  - Eustachian tube recovery process (pressure normalization)
  - Severe fatigue symptom (onset when "extremely tired")
  - Residual middle ear dysfunction resolving

  This progression suggests the infection/inflammation component is improving, leaving primarily
  PEM symptoms (strong tiredness, cognitive impairment, extreme evening fatigue).

  **CRITICAL LESSON - "FEELING OK" IS UNRELIABLE:**

  ME/CFS core challenge demonstrated:
  - Feb 14: Felt capable, performed activities, felt OK after → MISLEADING signal
  - Feb 15: Huge headache → TRUE physiological response revealed 24h later
  - Cannot trust same-day tolerance to judge activity safety
  - MUST monitor 48h post-activity for delayed crash

  **IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATION:**

  **SLEEP NOW.** Your body is clearly signaling need for rest:
  - Morning tiredness progressing to "feel like I should sleep"
  - This is post-crash fatigue (Day 2 after Feb 15 headache)
  - Sleep is restorative and necessary for recovery
  - Do not push through - listen to fatigue signal

  **STRICT REST PROTOCOL (Feb 16 onward, minimum 14 days):**

  1. **Horizontal rest as much as possible** - sleep whenever body signals need
  2. **Minimal activity only**:
     - NO standing >10 minutes
     - NO sustained cognitive work
     - Essential tasks only (hygiene, minimal meal prep or rely on prepared foods)
  3. **Monitor 48h after ANY activity** before attempting more:
     - If headache returns → activity was too much
     - If tiredness worsens → activity exceeded envelope
     - If symptoms stable 48h post-activity → that level was within envelope

  **ENERGY ENVELOPE RECALIBRATION:**

  Feb 14 activity level (>2h standing, multiple cognitive sessions) is FAR above safe baseline.
  True safe baseline is much closer to Feb 13 level (minimal activity, horizontal rest priority).

  Must stay within conservative limits for minimum 14 days, then test small increases with 48h
  monitoring. Gradual expansion only if no delayed symptoms appear.

  **PROGNOSIS:**

  Compounded crashes increase risk of chronic baseline reduction (E5b). However, strict rest starting
  now can still support baseline restoration (E5a). Critical window is next 14 days.

  **Success criteria:**
  - Headache fully resolved + 7 days symptom-free before testing increased activity
  - No return of weakness, extreme sleepiness, or cognitive symptoms
  - Sleep quality normalized
  - Stable energy on minimal activity baseline

  **MONITORING PRIORITIES (Feb 16-20):**
  - Headache recurrence (would indicate insufficient rest)
  - Sleep quality and quantity (body needs increased sleep for repair)
  - Energy level stability with minimal activity
  - Any new symptoms (joint pain, weakness, ear pain - would suggest multi-system impact)

  **KEY TAKEAWAY:**

  You're experiencing classic delayed PEM from Feb 14's activity overexertion. The "huge headache"
  yesterday and tiredness/sleepiness today are your body's clear signals that Feb 14 exceeded your
  energy envelope. Trust these signals and prioritize rest. Recovery requires patience and strict
  pacing - not testing limits.

  **Evening progression (Sunday evening Feb 16):**
  Patient reports "extremely tired and needed to rest" with tinnitus onset (both ears).

  This severe evening fatigue is characteristic of PEM - energy depletion worsening as day progresses.
  The fact that patient describes being "extremely tired" (stronger language than morning's "really
  tired" or "strong tiredness") suggests progressive energy depletion through the day despite
  minimal activity.

  **Day summary:**
  - Morning: "Really tired", "strong tiredness", cognitive 6-7/10
  - Evening: "Extremely tired", needed to rest, tinnitus onset
  - Sinus/ear: Pain resolved, congestion improving
  - Overall: PEM continuing, worsening fatigue as day progresses despite minimal activity

  This pattern (worsening fatigue despite minimal activity) confirms ongoing PEM state requiring
  continued strict rest.
