date: 2026-02-18
day: Wednesday
context: Day 7 post-Feb 12 crash - Day 4 post-secondary crash (Feb 14 overexertion → Feb 15 peak) — 48h monitoring window Day 1

medications:
  - name: Provigil (modafinil)
    dose: 1 tablet
    timing: morning
  - name: LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone)
    dose: 3mg
    timing: morning
  - name: Usual supplements
    notes: full usual protocol taken (patient confirmed "all supplements as planned")

activity:
  morning:
    - type: driving
      duration: 1h there + 1h back (2h total)
      timing: morning
      destination: doctor appointment
      notes: moderate cognitive and physical exertion — sustained driving requires attention and physical stamina

symptoms:
  energy:
    overall_status: good
    fatigue: barely present
    self_assessment: "barely feels tiredness"
    overall_assessment: Second consecutive good day. Maintained positive state despite 2h driving.

  cognitive_function:
    status: good
    impairment: none
    notes: |
      No brain fog reported. This is notable: 2h of driving requires sustained attention
      and cognitive engagement. Patient remained symptom-free cognitively throughout.

  pain:
    headache: absent
    body_pain: absent
    overall: absent

  effort_tolerance:
    activity_performed: 2h sustained driving (doctor appointment)
    post_activity_status: minimal fatigue, otherwise well
    clinical_note: |
      Today's doctor appointment involved 2h of total driving — a meaningful real-world
      activity test within the 48h monitoring window (Feb 18-19) identified yesterday.
      Patient reports minimal symptoms post-activity. This is an encouraging signal.
      Monitoring for delayed PEM tomorrow (Feb 19) remains essential before drawing
      conclusions about readiness for further activity increase.

interpretation: |
  MONITORING DAY 1 - Second consecutive good day, moderate activity tolerated

  **CONTEXT:**
  - Feb 12: Primary crash trigger
  - Feb 13: Peak of primary crash
  - Feb 14: Overexertion during recovery → secondary crash
  - Feb 15: Secondary crash peak (headache, sinus/ear symptoms)
  - Feb 16: Continuing PEM — extreme fatigue, tinnitus
  - Feb 17: First good day — recovery confirmed
  - Feb 18 (TODAY): Second good day — 2h driving tolerated, minimal fatigue

  **SIGNIFICANT:**
  - Patient completed 2h of driving (doctor appointment) and reports only barely perceptible tiredness
  - No brain fog, no pain, no headache — all domains clear
  - Full medication protocol maintained: Provigil + LDN 3mg + all supplements
  - Provigil use noted (first explicit mention) — important to track as confounding factor
    in energy and tolerance assessment

  **48h MONITORING WINDOW (Feb 18-19) - Day 1 ENCOURAGING:**
  - Day 1 of 2 monitoring days passed with real activity (2h driving) and minimal symptoms
  - This is better than expected — yesterday, patient was sedentary and uncertain about effort tolerance
  - Feb 19 remains critical: delayed PEM from today's activity may still appear

  **PROVIGIL NOTE:**
  Modafinil (Provigil) promotes wakefulness and reduces perceived fatigue — this may mask
  underlying fatigue levels. The "barely tiredness" self-report should be interpreted
  in this context. Actual energy envelope may be somewhat narrower than subjective experience.
  Continue monitoring especially on days without Provigil if applicable.

  **PACING GUIDANCE:**
  - Do NOT interpret today's tolerance as permission for significantly increased activity
  - Feb 14 pattern: felt well → overexerted → secondary crash
  - Wait for Feb 19 report before updating activity envelope
  - If Feb 19 remains symptom-free → cautious stepwise increase can be considered
