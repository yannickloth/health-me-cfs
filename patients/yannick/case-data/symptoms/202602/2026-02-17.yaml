date: 2026-02-17
day: Tuesday
context: Day 6 post-Feb 12 crash - Day 3 post-secondary crash (Feb 14 overexertion → Feb 15 peak)

medications:
  - name: LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone)
    dose: 3mg
    timing: morning
    notes: reduced from 4mg

supplements:
  - name: Magnesium Glycinate
    timing: morning
  - name: MetaDigest
    timing: morning
  - name: MCT Oil
    timing: morning
  - name: D-Ribose
    timing: evening
  - name: Usual supplements
    notes: full usual protocol taken (patient confirmed "all usual supplements")

activity:
  morning:
    - type: nap
      duration: ~1h30
      timing: morning
      notes: voluntary rest during what was otherwise a good day

symptoms:
  energy:
    overall_status: good
    fatigue: mostly absent
    self_assessment: "mostly not tired"
    overall_assessment: Significant improvement from Feb 16 - first good day after compounded PEM

  cognitive_function:
    status: good
    impairment: none
    notes: |
      Cognitive function fully restored compared to Feb 16 (6-7/10, moderately impaired).
      Patient reports no cognitive impairment today.

  weakness:
    status: absent
    notes: |
      No weakness reported. However, activity was predominantly sedentary:
      sitting at computer, on couch, driving. Absence of weakness at rest
      does not confirm full physical recovery.

  pain:
    headache: absent
    body_pain: absent
    neck_cramp:
      timing: evening
      onset: spontaneous
      description: crampe au cou spontanée en soirée
    overall: mostly absent — crampe cervicale spontanée en soirée

  effort_tolerance:
    patient_question: "wonders if could support some effort, and at which level"
    clinical_note: |
      Patient is curious about returning to effort. This is a meaningful positive signal
      (subjective sense of capacity returning) but must be interpreted cautiously.
      - Activity today was fully sedentary: computer, couch, driving
      - No physical demands were tested
      - Feb 14 showed: feeling capable ≠ being within safe envelope
      - 48h monitoring window (Feb 18-19) must pass before any activity increase
      - If Feb 18-19 remain symptom-free → cautious stepwise increase can be considered

patient_observations:
  treatment_effect_hypothesis:
    patient_question: "wondering if L-carnitine and LDN are starting to have visible effects"
    context: |
      LDN: reduced from 4mg to 3mg on Feb 12 and maintained at 3mg through Feb 13-17 (6 days)
      L-carnitine (LCAR): in supplement protocol since at least Feb 14
      Today is the first clearly good day after a compounded PEM crash sequence.
    clinical_note: |
      This is a plausible hypothesis worth tracking. Both agents have mechanisms
      that could contribute to the recovery pattern observed:
      - LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone): neuroimmune modulation, microglial inhibition,
        endorphin up-regulation; typical onset 4-12 weeks but some patients notice
        earlier changes; dose reduction from 4→3mg could also reduce side effects
        and improve tolerability
      - L-carnitine (acetyl-L-carnitine form): mitochondrial transport of fatty acids,
        ATP synthesis support, some evidence for fatigue reduction in ME/CFS;
        effects may become more apparent after sustained use
      However, confounding factors exist:
      - Natural PEM recovery trajectory (Day 3 post-peak is consistent with typical resolution)
      - Activity today was sedentary (computer, couch, driving) — reduced metabolic demand
      - Magnesium glycinate, D-ribose, MCT also support energy metabolism
      Data point to log for future pattern analysis — correlate with coming days.

interpretation: |
  RECOVERY DAY - First good day after compounded PEM crash

  **CONTEXT:**
  - Feb 12: Primary crash trigger
  - Feb 13: Peak of primary crash (weakness, extreme sleepiness)
  - Feb 14: Overexertion during primary recovery window
  - Feb 15: Secondary crash peak (huge headache all day + sinus/ear symptoms)
  - Feb 16: Continuing PEM - "really tired" → "extremely tired" in evening + tinnitus
  - Feb 17 (TODAY): Feeling GOOD - mostly not tired, no headache, no pain

  **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT:**

  This is the first clearly positive day after the compounded crash sequence.
  Absence of:
  - Fatigue / tiredness (mostly)
  - Headache (was the main symptom on Feb 15)
  - Pain (body pain absent)

  This pattern is consistent with ME/CFS recovery trajectory:
  - Peak symptoms: Feb 15-16
  - Gradual resolution: 48-72h after peak
  - Feb 17 (Day 3 post-peak): First good day

  **IMPORTANT CAUTION:**

  Feeling good today does NOT mean recovery is complete.
  Feb 14 demonstrated this exact trap: felt capable → overexerted → secondary crash 24h later.

  **STRICT 48h MONITORING REQUIRED:**
  Continue monitoring through Feb 18-19 before considering any activity increase.
  Feeling good is a necessary but NOT sufficient condition for safe activity resumption.

  **SUPPLEMENTS NOTE:**
  Full protocol maintained including:
  - LDN 3mg (neuroimmune modulation)
  - Magnesium glycinate (mitochondrial support, sleep quality)
  - MetaDigest (digestive enzyme support)
  - MCT oil (alternative energy substrate)
  - D-ribose (ATP synthesis support)

  Consistent supplement protocol through recovery period is appropriate.
  The metabolic support supplements (D-ribose, MCT, CoQ10 equivalents) are especially
  relevant during PEM recovery when energy metabolism is compromised.
