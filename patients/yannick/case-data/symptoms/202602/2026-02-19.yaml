    timing: morning
  - name: L-Carnitine
    dose: usual
    timing: morning
  - name: Urolithin + NAD+
    dose: usual
    timing: morning
  - name: CoQ10

    timing: morning
  - name: LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone)
    status: not mentioned (assumed not taken or forgotten during crash)
  - name: Provigil (modafinil)
    status: not taken (not mentioned)

activity:
  status: severe crash - minimal activity possible
  rest_required: patient reports need to sleep
  overall: forced rest due to severe symptoms

symptoms:
  energy:
    overall_status: crashing
    fatigue: severe
    self_assessment: "very tired, no energy"
    overall_assessment: |
      Complete energy collapse. Patient reports being "very tired" with "no energy"
      and explicit need to sleep. Classic severe PEM presentation.

  cognitive_function:
    status: not explicitly reported
    notes: |
      Patient did not report brain fog, but focus is entirely on physical exhaustion
      and headache. Cognitive status secondary to overwhelming physical symptoms.

  pain:
    headache: severe
    self_assessment: "strong headache"
    body_pain: absent
    other_pains: "no other pains reported"
    overall: headache dominates clinical picture

  pem_active: true
  pem_severity: 8/10
  pem_trigger: "2+ hours walking/shopping at Auchan on 2026-02-18 (exceeded energy envelope)"
  pem_onset: next-day (classic delayed presentation - felt good during and immediately after activity)
  pem_day: 1
  expected_duration: "3-7 days based on severity and patient history"

interpretation: |
  SEVERE PEM - CLASSIC PATTERN - 48h MONITORING WINDOW FAILED

  **CRASH TIMELINE:**
  - Feb 18 (Yesterday): Very good day → drove to Auchan → spent >2h walking/shopping
  - Feb 19 (TODAY): Complete crash - severe fatigue, strong headache, forced rest

  **CRITICAL PATTERN REPETITION:**
  This is the THIRD crash in 8 days following the EXACT same pattern:

  1. Feb 12 crash: trigger unknown → severe PEM
  2. Feb 14 secondary crash: felt good during recovery → overexerted → Feb 15 crash peak
  3. Feb 19 crash (TODAY): 2 good days → felt well → 2h+ activity → immediate next-day crash

  **PATIENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:**
  Patient explicitly acknowledges: "it was too much" - clear recognition that activity
  exceeded energy envelope, yet decision was made to proceed anyway.

  **48h MONITORING WINDOW - CRITICAL FAILURE:**
  - Feb 17: First good day identified → 48h monitoring window established (Feb 18-19)
  - Feb 18: Patient felt "very good" and chose to engage in 2h+ walking/shopping
  - Feb 19: Monitoring window Day 2 reveals SEVERE PEM from yesterday's activity
  - Conclusion: Patient was NOT ready for increased activity despite feeling well

  **MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE:**
  - Classic next-day PEM: patient felt "very good" during activity, crashed 24h later
  - Severity (8/10) indicates significant envelope breach
  - Strong headache + severe fatigue = hallmark ME/CFS crash symptoms
  - Pattern demonstrates: subjective wellbeing ≠ true energy capacity

  **MEDICATION CONTEXT:**
  - Feb 18: Patient took Provigil (modafinil) - wakefulness promoter
  - Provigil may have masked underlying fatigue and contributed to overestimation
    of energy capacity ("very good day" may have been pharmacologically enhanced)
  - Feb 19: No Provigil reported - true baseline state revealed in crash

  **PACING FAILURE ANALYSIS:**
  This crash demonstrates the core challenge in ME/CFS pacing:

  1. Patient feels well (subjective recovery)
  2. Patient engages in "normal" activity (2h shopping - routine for healthy individuals)
  3. Activity exceeds actual energy envelope (not apparent until 24h later)
  4. Severe PEM follows, erasing days of recovery progress

  The gap between "feeling good" and "having energy capacity" is the critical
  clinical challenge. Patient needs objective pacing tools, not subjective assessment.

  **TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS:**
  - 48h monitoring window is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT
  - Feeling well ≠ permission to increase activity
  - Need stricter activity limits: even on "very good days," maintain conservative envelope
  - Consider objective measures: heart rate monitoring, step count limits, time-based caps
  - Provigil use requires extra caution: may create false sense of capacity

  **EXPECTED RECOVERY:**
  - Based on severity (8/10) and patient history: 3-7 days
  - Feb 20-22: expect continued high symptoms (fatigue, headache)
  - Feb 23-25: gradual improvement if strict rest maintained
  - Feb 26: earliest possible return to baseline (if no further overexertion)

  **URGENT RECOMMENDATION:**
  - STRICT REST for next 3-5 days minimum
  - No discretionary activity during recovery
  - When baseline returns, do NOT immediately increase activity
  - Establish HARD LIMITS: time caps, exertion caps, objective metrics
  - Pattern must be broken - patient cannot rely on "feeling good" as activity clearance

clinical_notes: |
  This crash validates the concerns expressed in Feb 18 interpretation:
  "Do NOT interpret today's tolerance as permission for significantly increased activity"
  "Feb 14 pattern: felt well → overexerted → secondary crash"
  "Wait for Feb 19 report before updating activity envelope"

  The pattern has repeated exactly as predicted. Patient felt well, increased activity,
  and crashed. This is the second preventable secondary crash in 5 days.

  The challenge is not medical mystery - the pattern is clear and well-documented.
  The challenge is behavioral: establishing and maintaining strict pacing discipline
  even when patient feels capable of more.

  Recommend discussion with physician about:
  - Structured activity management plan with hard limits
  - Objective monitoring tools (heart rate, step counts)
  - Provigil usage strategy (may be counterproductive for pacing)
  - Psychological support for pacing adherence (very difficult to rest when feeling well)
