clinical_notes: |
  Continued household work despite joint and hip pain. This activity may represent exertion that triggered subsequent PEM episode. Energy level 4/10 suggests already limited capacity but continued activity anyway.

  Activity context:
  - Pain: Moderate (6/10) in joints and hips
  - Energy: Low (4/10)
  - Decision: Continued activity despite low energy and pain

  Clinical significance: Possible activity-triggered PEM precursor.
