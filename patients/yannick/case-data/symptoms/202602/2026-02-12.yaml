day: Thursday
context: Activity-triggered crash with autonomic dysregulation - good morning baseline deteriorated rapidly with standing activity

medications:
  - name: LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone)
    dose: 3mg
    notes: reduced from typical 4mg dose
  - name: Cetirizine
    dose: 1 pill
    notes: antihistamine

supplements: none taken

sleep:
  afternoon: 1h20
  quality: did not restore energy - still weak/tired upon waking

activity:
  first_ironing_session:
    time: ~11:15-11:45
    duration: 30 minutes
    type: standing/ironing clothes
    symptoms_during: weakness onset, elevated pulse
    symptoms_after: hypoglycemic-like feeling, strong desire to lie down
    functional_impact: needed to feed child despite strong rest urge

  second_ironing_session:
    time: afternoon (post-nap)
    duration: 30 minutes
    type: standing/ironing clothes
    symptoms_after: tired, at limit of headache and crash, attempting to rest

symptoms:
  morning_09_45:
    cognitive_function: good/alert
    cognitive_description: "brain is good, really alert"
    physical_status: "feels good but like it could become tired very quickly"
    physical_fragility: high - patient noted rapid tiredness potential

  post_first_activity_11_45:
    weakness: generalized
    pulse: quite elevated
    hypoglycemic_feeling: present (similar to Feb 11 pattern)
    fatigue: strong desire to immediately lie down and rest
    functional_pressure: needed to feed child despite symptoms

  post_nap_afternoon:
    weakness: persistent
    fatigue: "still feel weak, tired"
    energy_restoration: incomplete despite 1h20 sleep

  post_second_activity_late_afternoon:
    fatigue: persistent
    headache: "at the limit"
    crash_risk: imminent - patient attempting to lie down
    overall_status: "probably crash"

interpretation: |
  CRITICAL PATTERN: Activity-triggered crash with autonomic dysregulation despite good morning baseline.

  Timeline:
  - 09:45: Good cognitive state, body "fragile" but functional
  - 11:45: After 30min standing/ironing → weakness, elevated pulse, hypoglycemic feeling
  - Afternoon: 1h20 sleep → incomplete recovery
  - Late afternoon: Second 30min ironing → approaching headache and crash

  Key clinical observations:

  1. **Activity threshold severely reduced**: 30 minutes of standing activity exceeded energy envelope
     despite good morning baseline. This is consistent with depleted metabolic reserves.

  2. **Autonomic dysregulation**: Elevated pulse and hypoglycemic-like feeling (without actual
     hypoglycemia) mirrors Feb 11 pattern. Suggests autonomic nervous system unable to maintain
     cardiovascular stability during upright activity.

  3. **Rest non-restorative**: 1h20 afternoon sleep did not restore energy reserves. Patient remained
     weak and tired post-nap, indicating true metabolic depletion rather than simple fatigue.

  4. **Progressive deterioration**: Second activity session (another 30min ironing) pushed patient to
     "limit of headache and crash" - classic PEM progression.

  5. **Hypoglycemic-like pattern recurrence**: Second occurrence in 2 days (Feb 11 + Feb 12) of
     hypoglycemic-like symptoms (weakness, tremor-risk, elevated pulse) without confirmed glucose
     measurement. This strongly supports Hypothesis 2C (Autonomic State Transition Failure) and/or
     metabolic dysfunction.

  Competing hypotheses:
  - Delayed PEM from recent activity accumulation (Feb 11 grocery + Feb 12 ironing)
  - Autonomic dysregulation triggered by postural stress (standing activities)
  - Metabolic/mitochondrial ATP depletion (inability to sustain standing work)
  - Stimulant absence (no Provigil/Ritalin) reducing compensatory support

  **URGENT CONCERN**: Patient experiencing functional pressure (needing to feed child) while in
  symptomatic state. This forced continuation of activity despite clear physiological signals to rest.

  The morning baseline "fragility" warning proved accurate - body signaled limited reserves that were
  quickly exceeded. This demonstrates value of morning self-assessment for activity planning.

  **Recommendation**: Strict rest for remainder of day. Monitor for PEM development over next 24-48h.
  Consider whether stimulant support (Provigil/Ritalin) might prevent such rapid deterioration on
  necessary-activity days.
