day: Wednesday
context: Post-stimulant recovery day (no Ritalin or Provigil); baseline LDN only

medications:
  - name: LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone)
    dose: 4mg
  - name: Ritalin MR (methylphenidate)
    dose: null
    notes: not taken
  - name: Modafinil (Provigil)
    dose: null
    notes: not taken

supplements: none taken

hydration:
  - name: Electrolyte-water
    amount: unmeasured (added to every water bottle)
    composition: dry electrolyte-sugar mix
    notes: patient adds electrolyte mix to each water bottle but does not measure amounts

sleep:
  night: interrupted multiple times due to diffuse pain in right buttock
  morning: 1.5 hours
  afternoon: 2.5-3 hours (awoke ~14:50-15:00)
  total: 4-4.5 hours daytime (fragmented pattern)
  quality: excessive daytime sleep despite nighttime interruptions

activity:
  morning_grocery_shopping:
    duration: 1h20 walking in shop aisles
    symptoms_during: tired at end of shopping
    symptoms_after: leg fatigue/pain persisting

autonomic_event:
  wake_time: 14:50-15:00
  weakness_phase:
    time: 15:00-15:25 (25 minutes)
    symptoms: generalized weakness
    context: during driving
  tremor_phase:
    time: 15:25-15:50 (25 minutes)
    symptoms: shaking/tremors similar to hypoglycemia
    context: during driving
  resolution:
    time: 15:50 onward
    outcome: tremors settled, fatigue persists

symptoms:
  energy: 2/10 (post-wake), persistent fatigue throughout day
  cognitive_function: 3/10 (post-wake period), improved to baseline later in day
  cognitive_status_evening: "everything feels fine cognitively"
  weakness: generalized, including leg weakness (post-wake period)
  tremors: present 15:25-15:50, resolved by evening
  pain:
    - location: right buttock (diffuse)
      timing: nocturnal (woke patient multiple times)
      severity: sufficient to interrupt sleep
    - location: legs
      timing: post-grocery shopping
      context: after 1h20 walking activity

interpretation: |
  Post-stimulant recovery day (no Ritalin MR or Provigil from Monday).

  Morning activity (1h20 grocery shopping) preceded afternoon autonomic dysregulation event.

  Timeline:
  - Morning: 1h20 walking → tired, leg pain
  - Afternoon: Sleep 2.5-3h → wake 14:50-15:00 → autonomic event (weakness + tremors, 15:00-15:50)
  - Evening: Cognitive recovery, physical fatigue persists

  Autonomic dysregulation event strongly supports Hypothesis 2C: Autonomic State Transition Failure.
  Pattern characteristics:
  - Temporal correlation with wake transition (not random)
  - Organized 25-min phases (weakness → tremors → resolution)
  - Cognitive preservation (rules out metabolic crash)
  - Context sensitivity (post-stimulant, post-activity)

  Competing hypotheses:
  1. Stimulant withdrawal/rebound (CNS downregulation after Monday activation)
  2. Hypoglycemic-like metabolic crash (ATP depletion from Monday + Wednesday morning activity)
  3. Delayed PEM from activity enabled by Monday's stimulant + Wednesday morning grocery shopping

  Key diagnostic observation: Cognitive function recovered by evening while physical symptoms persisted.
  This dissociation (cognitive recovery but physical fatigue/pain persists) is characteristic of autonomic
  dysregulation during state transitions, not global metabolic failure.

  The morning grocery shopping (1h20) exceeded energy envelope, contributing to afternoon crash during
  sleep-wake transition. The autonomic system struggled to transition from sleep to wake state, producing
  the characteristic weakness → tremors → resolution pattern over 50 minutes.

  Night sleep disrupted by right buttock pain suggests musculoskeletal stress from recent activity levels.
