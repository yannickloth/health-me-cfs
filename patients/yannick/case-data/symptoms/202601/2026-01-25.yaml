  ACUTE UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION (likely viral)

  This represents a NEW acute illness episode overlaid on baseline ME/CFS.
  Clinical significance:

  1. INFECTION TRIGGER: Acute infections often trigger PEM and can worsen
     baseline ME/CFS symptoms for weeks to months

  2. ORTHOSTATIC WORSENING: Orthostatic symptoms (sweating from standing,
     extreme exhaustion from standing) are severely worsened beyond baseline

  3. MONITORING REQUIRED: Need to track:
     - Duration of acute infection
     - Development of post-viral PEM (may occur 24-72h after infection onset)
     - Return to baseline symptoms vs. new baseline deterioration
     - Potential need for crisis management protocols if severe PEM develops

  4. SYMPTOM PATTERN:
     - Throat pain (hot sensation) - acute viral pattern
     - Posterior runny nose - acute viral pattern
     - Ear pain - possible viral Eustachian tube inflammation
     - Headache - managed with paracetamol
     - Sweating from standing - severe orthostatic intolerance worsening
     - Standing extremely exhausting - functional capacity severely reduced

  5. TREATMENT APPROACH:
     - Rest (essential - avoid triggering PEM)
     - Symptomatic management (paracetamol for headache/pain)
     - No stimulants (appropriate during acute illness)
     - Monitor for bacterial superinfection
     - Prepare for potential post-infectious crash

expected_course: |
  Typical post-infection trajectory in ME/CFS:
  - Days 1-3: Acute infection symptoms dominant
  - Days 3-7: Acute symptoms resolve, potential PEM onset
  - Days 7-14: Post-viral fatigue and PEM peak
  - Weeks 2-4: Gradual recovery toward baseline (if no complications)
  - Risk: Permanent baseline worsening (documented in some ME/CFS patients)
