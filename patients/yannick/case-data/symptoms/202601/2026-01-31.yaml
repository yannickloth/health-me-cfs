  POST-ACTIVITY RECOVERY DAY - HIGH PEM RISK

  Status: Day after cooking-triggered weakness episode

  CURRENT SYMPTOMS:
  - Feeling weak (generalized)
  - Energy: 3/10 (significantly reduced from yesterday morning 7/10)
  - Brain fog: 4/10, "even head" = cognitive fatigue present
  - Pain: 5/10, diffuse around joints/muscles
  - Head status: OK (no headache/migraine)

  MEDICATION STRATEGY:
  - Using Provigil (stimulant support)
  - NOT using Ritalin (avoiding stacking stimulants)
  - Suggests patient is using minimal necessary support

  PATIENT INSIGHT:
  "Feels at risk of provoking PEM if does too much"
  - Excellent self-awareness
  - Appropriate activity limitation
  - Priority: recovery, not activity

  CLINICAL TRAJECTORY:
  Day 0 (Jan 30 AM): Energy 7/10, good baseline
  Day 0 (Jan 30 PM): Cooking 30-45min → weakness triggered
  Day 1 (Jan 31): Energy 3/10, weakness + diffuse pain, high PEM risk

  PAIN CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Diffuse around joints
  - Involves both muscles and joints
  - Pain level 5/10 (moderate)
  - This pattern is consistent with post-exertional inflammation

  MANAGEMENT APPROACH:
  Patient is correctly prioritizing:
  1. Recovery over activity
  2. Avoiding PEM threshold
  3. Not testing hypotheses during vulnerable state
  4. Using minimal medication support

  PROGNOSIS:
  - If activity remains minimal: likely recovery in 24-48 hours
  - If activity exceeds envelope: risk of progression to full PEM
  - Current trajectory shows good awareness and appropriate limitation

alerts:
  - type: "PEM_RISK_HIGH"
    severity: "MODERATE"
    message: "Patient at high risk of PEM - activity limitation essential"
  - type: "APPROPRIATE_MANAGEMENT"
    severity: "LOW"
    message: "Patient demonstrating good self-awareness and pacing"
  - type: "PAIN_PATTERN_NOTED"
    severity: "INFORMATIONAL"
    message: "Diffuse musculoskeletal pain - monitor if progresses"
