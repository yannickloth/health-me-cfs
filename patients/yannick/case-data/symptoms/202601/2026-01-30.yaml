  ACTIVITY-TRIGGERED WEAKNESS EPISODE

  Morning baseline: Good day (energy 7/10, head OK, minimal symptoms)

  TRIGGER EVENT: Cooking pancakes (30-45 minutes)
  - Patient identified cooking as the specific trigger moment
  - Weakness onset during the activity
  - This was NOT a pre-existing weakness - it started with the activity

  Post-activity state:
  - Calm evening, primarily sitting at computer
  - Weakness persisted but did not progress to full PEM
  - Suggests successful limitation of activity after trigger recognition

  CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  1. Clear activity threshold identification
  2. Cooking for 30-45 minutes exceeded energy envelope on this day
  3. Patient recognized trigger and adjusted activity appropriately
  4. No stimulants taken - baseline day without medication support
  5. This duration of cooking may be a useful marker for activity limits

  PACING IMPLICATIONS:
  - Cooking duration > 30 minutes may require breaks
  - Consider sitting while cooking or splitting tasks
  - Good day baseline does not guarantee activity tolerance
  - Patient successfully avoided escalation to PEM through rest

alerts:
  - type: "ACTIVITY_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIED"
    severity: "INFORMATIONAL"
    message: "Cooking 30-45min triggered weakness - useful threshold marker"
  - type: "SUCCESSFUL_LIMITATION"
    severity: "LOW"
    message: "Patient limited activity after trigger, prevented PEM escalation"
