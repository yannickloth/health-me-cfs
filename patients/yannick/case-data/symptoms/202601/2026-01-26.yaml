  TINNITUS AS FATIGUE BIOMARKER - CLINICAL PATTERN IDENTIFIED

  Patient reports reproducible correlation between tinnitus intensity and fatigue state:
  - Present: When fatigued (100% correlation by patient report)
  - Absent: When not fatigued (100% correlation by patient report)

  This pattern has significant clinical value:

  1. SUBJECTIVE ENERGY RESERVE INDICATOR
     - Could be used as real-time warning signal for energy depletion
     - May help guide pacing decisions
     - Potential early warning before PEM threshold

  2. NEUROLOGICAL FATIGUE MARKER
     - Tinnitus in ME/CFS may reflect central nervous system dysregulation
     - Could indicate impaired central auditory processing when energy-depleted
     - Suggests neurological component to fatigue (not purely muscular)

  3. AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION CORRELATION
     - Tinnitus has documented associations with autonomic dysfunction
     - May reflect cerebral hypoperfusion during fatigue states
     - Could correlate with orthostatic intolerance episodes

  4. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS
     - This pattern should be tracked systematically
     - Could be validated with objective fatigue measures (e.g., CPET)
     - May be generalizable to other ME/CFS patients as biomarker

  5. CONTEXT OF CURRENT ILLNESS
     - Currently experiencing day 2 of acute upper respiratory infection
     - Fatigue is elevated due to infection
     - Tinnitus intensity correspondingly elevated
     - Pattern remains consistent even during acute illness

  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
  - Create systematic tinnitus tracking protocol
  - Document tinnitus presence/absence with all symptom logs
  - Correlate with objective measures when available (heart rate, activity data)
  - Consider adding to pacing-coach indicators
  - Track whether pattern remains stable during recovery from acute illness
