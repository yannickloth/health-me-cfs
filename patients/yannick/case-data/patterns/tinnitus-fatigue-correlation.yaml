pattern_id: tinnitus_fatigue_correlation
pattern_name: "Tinnitus Intensity as Fatigue Biomarker"
first_identified: "2026-01-26"
identification_method: "patient_reported"

description: |
  Patient reports clear, reproducible correlation between tinnitus intensity and
  fatigue state. Tinnitus is consistently present during fatigue and consistently
  absent when not fatigued.

patient_observation:
  specificity: "Always present when tired, never present when not tired"
  reliability: high
  reproducibility: "Patient reports 100% correlation"
  confidence: "Patient very confident in this pattern"

clinical_significance:
  potential_mechanisms:
    - mechanism: "Neurological fatigue marker"
      rationale: "May reflect central nervous system dysregulation during energy depletion"
      certainty: medium
    - mechanism: "Autonomic dysfunction correlation"
      rationale: "Tinnitus has documented associations with autonomic dysfunction in literature"
      certainty: medium
    - mechanism: "Cerebral hypoperfusion indicator"
      rationale: "May reflect reduced cerebral blood flow during fatigue states"
      certainty: low
    - mechanism: "Orthostatic intolerance relationship"
      rationale: "Could correlate with orthostatic episodes given autonomic connection"
      certainty: low

  clinical_utility:
    - use: "Real-time energy reserve indicator"
      value: high
      application: "Patient can use tinnitus presence as warning signal for pacing"
    - use: "PEM prevention tool"
      value: high
      application: "Stop activity when tinnitus appears to prevent PEM threshold crossing"
    - use: "Subjective fatigue validation"
      value: medium
      application: "Objective marker to validate subjective fatigue reports"
    - use: "Pacing guidance"
      value: high
      application: "Integrate into pacing-coach decision algorithms"

literature_context:
  known_associations:
    - finding: "Tinnitus is reported in ME/CFS patient populations"

      certainty: high
    - finding: "Cerebral hypoperfusion can cause tinnitus"
      source: "Neurology literature"
      certainty: high

  research_gaps:
    - question: "What percentage of ME/CFS patients experience tinnitus-fatigue correlation?"
      priority: high
    - question: "Is this pattern specific to certain ME/CFS subtypes?"
