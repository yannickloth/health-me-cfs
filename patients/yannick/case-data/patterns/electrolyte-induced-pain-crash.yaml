# CRITICAL CONTEXT
clinical_context: |
  Patient is currently managing ME/CFS with priority on recovery.
  Patient will NOT stop treatment to test hypotheses.
  This pattern should be monitored PASSIVELY only.
  Any future observations should be opportunistic, not experimental.

# EPISODE TIMELINE
timeline:
  - date: "unknown_afternoon"
    day_label: "Day 1 (afternoon)"
    event: "Patient took electrolytes"
    notes: "Specific date not documented"

  - date: "Thursday morning"
    day_label: "Day 2 (Thursday morning)"
    event: "Patient took electrolytes again"

  - date: "Thursday noon"
    day_label: "Day 2 (Thursday noon, ~3h after dose)"
    event: "CRASH - 2.5 hour duration with pain"
    severity: "significant"
    duration_hours: 2.5
    symptoms:
      - "pain (primary symptom)"
      - "diffuse pain around joints/muscles"
      - "required nap for recovery"

  - date: "Thursday afternoon"
    day_label: "Day 2 (post-nap)"
    event: "Pain resolved relatively quickly after nap"
    notes: "Rapid resolution suggests acute episode, not sustained crash"

# SYMPTOM CHARACTERISTICS
pain_characteristics:
  location: "diffuse around joints and muscles"
  quality: "not specified"
  severity: "sufficient to require 2.5h nap"
  onset_timing: "~3 hours after second electrolyte dose"
  resolution: "relatively quick after nap"
  duration: "approximately 2.5 hours"

# PATIENT HYPOTHESIS
patient_hypothesis:
  mechanism: "sudden increase in ions → enhanced neural signaling → pain"
  reasoning: |
    Patient proposes that rapid electrolyte supplementation may have
    increased ion concentrations, potentially enhancing neural signaling
    pathways and triggering pain response.

  plausibility_assessment: |
    POTENTIALLY PLAUSIBLE but requires caution:

    1. SUPPORTING MECHANISMS:
       - Electrolyte imbalances can affect neuronal excitability
       - Rapid ion shifts may trigger nerve hypersensitivity
       - Some ME/CFS patients report sensitivities to supplements
       - Ion channel dysfunction is hypothesized in ME/CFS pathophysiology

    2. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS:
       - Coincidental timing with other triggers
       - Delayed response to prior day's activity
       - Orthostatic stress from electrolyte-induced fluid shifts
       - Detox/herxheimer-like reaction to supplement ingredients
       - Random symptom fluctuation unrelated to electrolytes

    3. CONFOUNDING FACTORS:
       - Single episode only
       - Exact electrolyte formulation not documented
       - Dose not documented
       - Baseline symptom state not documented
       - Other concurrent medications/supplements not documented

# VARIABLES TO TRACK (if pattern repeats opportunistically)
tracking_recommendations:
  if_pattern_repeats_track:
    - electrolyte_type: "specific formulation (Na, K, Mg, Ca ratios)"
    - dose: "amount taken"
    - timing: "time of day, relation to meals"
    - baseline_state: "symptom severity before supplementation"
    - onset_delay: "time from dose to symptom onset"
    - concurrent_medications: "what else was taken same day"
    - hydration_status: "water intake before/after"
    - activity_level: "any exertion before or after"
    - resolution_factors: "what helped resolve (nap, time, other)"

  do_not:
    - "Intentionally provoke episodes to test hypothesis"
    - "Modify treatment plan to test this pattern"
    - "Recommend stopping electrolytes without physician guidance"
    - "Suggest experimental protocols during recovery priority"

# CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
clinical_assessment: |
  INSUFFICIENT DATA - SINGLE EPISODE

  This pattern requires:
  1. Replication (does it happen again?)
  2. Temporal consistency (same timing each time?)
  3. Dose-response relationship (higher dose = worse pain?)
  4. Specificity (only with electrolytes, not other supplements?)

  CURRENT RECOMMENDATION:
  - Continue current treatment as prescribed
  - Passively observe if pattern repeats
  - Document thoroughly if it happens again
  - Do NOT modify treatment to test hypothesis
  - Discuss with physician if pattern becomes consistent
