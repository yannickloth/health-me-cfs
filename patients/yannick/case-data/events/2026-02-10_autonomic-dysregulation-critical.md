# URGENT: Autonomic Dysregulation Event - 2026-02-11

**Date/Time:** 2026-02-11, 14:50-15:50 (60-minute duration)
**Status:** CRITICAL DRIVING SAFETY ISSUE
**Coordination Required:** Medical advisor, Crisis manager, Hypothesis generator

## Event Timeline

### Wake-Up Phase (14:50-15:00)
- Woke from fragmented sleep
- Sleep pattern: 1.5h + 2.5-3h (interrupted, total 4-4.5h)
- No stimulants on this day (post-Ritalin rebound day - discontinuation effect)

### Phase 1: Weakness (15:00-15:25)
- **Duration:** 25 minutes
- **Activity Context:** While driving
- **Symptoms:** Weakness, loss of strength
- **Severity:** Significant enough to create safety concern during vehicle operation

### Phase 2: Tremors/Shaking (15:25-15:50)
- **Duration:** 25 minutes
- **Activity Context:** While driving (CONTINUING after weakness phase)
- **Symptoms:** Tremors, shaking, involuntary movement
- **Severity:** Severe enough to significantly impair driving safety

### Phase 3: Resolution (15:50 onward)
- **Duration:** 25+ minutes (ongoing at observation time)
- **Symptoms:** Tremors settled
- **Cognitive Function:** OK (preserved)
- **Remaining Symptoms:** Fatigue
- **Baseline Functional Capacity:** Recovering toward baseline

## Critical Pattern Analysis

### Matches Hypothesis 2C (Autonomic State Transition Failure)

**Evidence supporting Hypothesis 2C:**

1. **Temporal Correlation with Wake-Up**
   - Event occurred immediately after waking
   - Suggests failure of autonomic nervous system adjustment during sleep-wake transition
   - Clear temporal boundary (14:50-15:50 window)

2. **Progression Pattern**
   - Phase 1: Weakness (motor/strength deficit)
   - Phase 2: Tremors/shaking (autonomic tremor signature)
   - Phase 3: Resolution (restoration of autonomic homeostasis)
   - Suggestive of defined physiological process with predictable phases

3. **25-Minute Phase Structure**
   - Each major phase lasted ~25 minutes
   - Suggests biological clock/rhythmic process
   - May reflect autonomic recovery window

4. **Preserved Cognition**
   - Brain function remained intact throughout
   - Indicates primary autonomic dysfunction, not CNS failure
   - Rules out severe metabolic compromise

5. **Post-Ritalin Rebound Context**
   - Absence of stimulant on this day (discontinuation effect from Ritalin)
   - May reveal underlying autonomic dysregulation typically masked by stimulant support
   - Timing consistent with rebound phenomenon (worse on day after stimulant omission)

## Immediate Safety Concerns

### Driving During Event
- **Duration:** 50 minutes of weakness + tremors while operating vehicle
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL - vehicle control impaired
- **Current Status:** Presumably pulled over or arrived at destination safely
- **Future Risk:** Unable to predict when event will recur

### Pattern Implications
- Event may be reproducible (triggered by specific state: post-wake, post-Ritalin)
- May occur without warning
- 50-minute duration exceeds safe activity window for any safety-sensitive operation
- Preserved cognition suggests patient was aware of impairment but autonomic system couldn't respond appropriately

## Medical Needs Assessment

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Driving Safety Protocol**
   - Medical clearance required before driving
   - Recommendation: Do not drive until autonomic mechanism identified and managed
   - If must drive: Plan for supervised/safety features

2. **Autonomic Function Testing**
   - **Tilt Table Test** (HIGH PRIORITY) - directly tests autonomic response to postural change
   - **Holter Monitor** (24-48h) - captures tremor patterns and heart rate dysrhythmia
   - **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Testing** - quantifies autonomic tone asymmetry
   - **Orthostatic Vital Signs** - baseline assessment
   - **Tremor Characterization** - distinguish central vs peripheral origin

3. **Medication Review**
   - Current Ritalin use/discontinuation effects
   - Interaction with post-Ritalin rebound day
   - Other medications that might interact with autonomic function

### Follow-Up (Important)
1. **Pattern Monitoring**
   - Occurrence frequency (is this isolated or recurring?)
   - Time of day (always after morning wake?)
   - Relationship to Ritalin dosing cycle
   - Relationship to sleep fragmentation

2. **Mechanistic Investigation**
   - Sympathetic vs parasympathetic dominance assessment
   - Neuroendocrine evaluation (cortisol, ACTH timing)
   - Cerebral autoregulation testing

## Hypothesis 2C Confidence Assessment

### Current Evidence Strength: STRONG

**Supporting factors (weight):**
- Temporal precision (immediate post-wake) - HIGH
- Phase structure (organized progression) - HIGH
- Preserved cognition (autonomic-specific) - HIGH
- Post-Ritalin context (rebound mechanism) - MODERATE-HIGH
- 25-minute rhythm (biological clock marker) - MODERATE

**Confidence Level Update Needed:**
- Previous assessment: [CHECK APPENDIX I-C]
- This event provides direct mechanistic evidence
- Recommend: Upgrade confidence from provisional to "strong candidate requiring testing"

**Next Steps for Hypothesis Confirmation:**
1. Tilt table test (will show autonomic dysregulation)
2. Holter monitor (will capture tremor timing and HR patterns)
3. Repeat documentation of event if recurs (pattern confirmation)

## Documentation Status

### Records Created
- This event file: `/home/nicky/code/health-me-cfs/.claude/case-data/events/2026-02-11_autonomic-dysregulation-critical.md`
- Awaiting case-documenter update to appendix-i-personal-symptoms.tex
- Awaiting hypothesis-generator update to appendix-i-c-case-analysis.tex
- Awaiting crisis-manager medical safety documentation

### Missing Information
- Exact time ended (assumed 15:50+)
- Whether drove remainder of trip or pulled over
- Heart rate during event (if monitored)
- Exact severity ratings (weakness 1-10?, tremors 1-10?)
- Current status update (still fatigued? recovered? how long total recovery?)

## Coordination Tasks

### 1. Crisis Manager (IMMEDIATE)
- [ ] Generate driving safety protocol
- [ ] Create emergency action plan for future events
- [ ] Document medical evaluation urgency
- [ ] Provide temporary activity restrictions
- [ ] Generate urgent care documentation template

### 2. Case Documenter (IMMEDIATE)
- [ ] Create detailed symptom log with precise timing
- [ ] Document medication context (Ritalin discontinuation)
- [ ] Log baseline energy/function for context
- [ ] Update Appendix I with event details
- [ ] Flag for hypothesis-generator analysis

### 3. Hypothesis Generator (NEXT)
- [ ] Update Hypothesis 2C confidence assessment
- [ ] Propose diagnostic testing sequence
- [ ] Generate testable predictions
- [ ] Identify biomarkers to measure
- [ ] Create hypothesis validation protocol
- [ ] Update Appendix I-C case analysis

### 4. Medical Advisor (FOLLOW-UP)
- [ ] Review autonomic-targeted treatments
- [ ] Generate "Questions for Your Doctor" list
- [ ] Recommend specialist evaluation (cardiologist? autonomic specialist?)
- [ ] Suggest diagnostic pathway
- [ ] Update treatment priorities based on Hypothesis 2C
