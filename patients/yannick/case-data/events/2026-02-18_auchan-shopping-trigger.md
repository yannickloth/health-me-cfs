# Event: Auchan Shopping Trip - PEM Trigger Event

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Day:** Wednesday
**Context:** Day 7 post-Feb 12 crash - Day 4 post-secondary crash - 48h monitoring window Day 1

---

## Event Details

**Activity:** Shopping trip to Auchan supermarket
**Duration:** >2 hours (walking and shopping)
**Exertion Type:** Sustained upright activity (walking, standing, browsing, carrying items)
**Patient State During Activity:** "Very good day" - felt well, minimal symptoms
**Provigil:** Patient had taken 1 tablet Provigil (modafinil) in morning

---

## Activity Breakdown

- **Driving:** To/from Auchan (duration not specified, likely 20-40min each way)
- **Walking/Shopping:** >2 hours sustained activity in store
  - Walking between aisles
  - Standing to browse products
  - Cognitive engagement (decision-making, navigation, transaction)
  - Physical load (carrying basket/cart, loading car)
- **Upright Time:** Total upright time likely 2.5-3 hours (driving + shopping)

---

## Clinical Significance

### Energy Envelope Breach

**Patient's Baseline Tolerance (established from recent history):**
- 2h driving (Feb 18 morning doctor appointment): tolerated with minimal fatigue
- Sedentary days (Feb 16-17 recovery): required for symptom resolution

**This Event:**
- 2+ hours walking/shopping PLUS driving
- Significantly exceeds established tolerance
- Patient acknowledges post-event: "it was too much"

### Why This Triggered PEM

1. **Cumulative Load:** Driving + 2h+ walking exceeds single-activity tolerance
2. **Orthostatic Stress:** ME/CFS patients often have orthostatic intolerance - sustained upright activity is particularly taxing
3. **Multiple Demand Domains:**
   - Physical: walking, standing, carrying
   - Cognitive: navigation, decisions, social interaction at checkout
   - Sensory: bright lights, noise, visual stimulation in large store
4. **Post-Exertional Malaise Mechanism:** Activity appeared tolerable during execution, but triggered delayed multi-system crash

## Confounding Factors

### Provigil (Modafinil) Use

**Relevant:** Patient took Provigil on morning of event

**Pharmacological Effect:**
- Wakefulness promoter
- Reduces subjective perception of fatigue
- Does NOT increase actual energy capacity in ME/CFS

**Clinical Impact:**
- Patient felt "very good" - may have been pharmacologically enhanced state
- Subjective wellbeing likely masked underlying energy depletion
- Created false sense of activity tolerance
- Patient made activity decisions based on masked fatigue signals

**Evidence:** Feb 19 (next day) - no Provigil reported, severe crash revealed true state

## Pattern Analysis

### Recurrent Crash Pattern (3 events in 8 days)

| Event | Trigger | Outcome | Pattern |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Feb 12 | Unknown activity | Feb 13 crash | Initial PEM episode |
| Feb 14 | Overexertion during recovery | Feb 15 crash | Secondary crash during recovery |
| Feb 18 | 2h+ shopping | Feb 19 crash | Tertiary crash - same pattern |

**Common Elements:**
- Patient feels well before activity
- Activity seems reasonable/normal
- Patient engages in activity
- Next-day severe crash follows
- Patient recognizes in retrospect: "it was too much"

**Core Problem:** Subjective wellbeing ≠ objective energy capacity

## Timeline Context

**Recent History Leading to This Event:**

- **Feb 12:** Primary crash trigger
- **Feb 13:** Peak of primary crash
- **Feb 14:** Overexertion during recovery → secondary trigger
- **Feb 15:** Secondary crash peak (headache, sinus/ear symptoms)
- **Feb 16:** Continuing severe PEM (extreme fatigue, tinnitus)
- **Feb 17:** First good day - recovery confirmed
- **Feb 18 (THIS EVENT):** Second good day - felt "very good" - chose to shop 2h+
- **Feb 19:** Severe crash (fatigue 8/10, strong headache, forced rest)

**Critical Observation:**
48h monitoring window (Feb 18-19) was established specifically to assess readiness for increased activity. Patient felt well on Day 1 and chose to significantly increase activity. Day 2 revealed severe PEM - monitoring window correctly identified NOT READY status, but patient had already overexerted on Day 1.

## Patient Insight

**Quote:** "it was too much"
**Timing:** Stated on Feb 19 after crash occurred

**Significance:**
- Patient has clear retrospective awareness
- Recognition comes AFTER crash, not during activity
- Pattern suggests: patient can recognize limits in hindsight but not in real-time
- Clinical challenge: bridging awareness gap between "during activity" and "post-crash"

---

## Treatment Implications

### Immediate (Post-Event)

- Strict rest for 3-5 days minimum
- Monitor symptom progression (expect Feb 20-22 to remain severe)
- No discretionary activity during recovery period

### Long-Term (Pattern Prevention)

**Need for Objective Pacing Tools:**
- Subjective assessment ("I feel good") is unreliable
- Provigil use complicates subjective assessment further
- Require external limits: time caps, step counts, HR monitoring

**Proposed Hard Limits:**
- Maximum upright time per day: 1.5 hours (including all driving, standing, walking)
- Maximum single-activity duration: 45 minutes
- Mandatory rest breaks every 30 minutes during activity
- No multiple demanding activities in single day

**Provigil Strategy Reassessment:**
- Current use may be counterproductive for pacing
- Discuss with physician: continue for specific situations vs. discontinue to improve awareness
- If continued: do NOT use "feeling good on Provigil" as activity clearance

**Behavioral Support:**
- Pacing adherence is psychologically difficult (hardest when feeling well)
- Consider structured activity plan with caregiver oversight
- Pre-commit to limits before "good days" arrive

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **48h monitoring window is necessary but not sufficient** - patient must maintain conservative limits even during monitoring period
2. **"Feeling very good" is a danger signal** - indicates high risk of overexertion in ME/CFS
3. **Provigil complicates pacing** - masked fatigue signals contributed to poor activity decision
4. **2h+ upright activity exceeds envelope** - clear threshold established
5. **Pattern repeats predictably** - without intervention, will continue to cycle

---

## Physician Discussion Points

- Review this event timeline with Dr. Nicolas (patient saw on Feb 18 morning)
- Discuss objective activity limits and monitoring strategy
- Reassess Provigil usage in context of pacing challenges
- Consider referral to occupational therapy for structured pacing program
- Explore psychological support for pacing adherence
