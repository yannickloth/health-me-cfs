## Certificat d'Interruption d'Activité

**Médecin:** Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nicolas
**Motif:** ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)
**Période:** 2026-04-01 → 2026-06-30 (3 mois)

## New Prescriptions / Protocol Changes

### 1. LDN — Dose Escalation to 4.5 mg

**Current dose:** 3 mg (maintained since Feb 12 after reduction from 4 mg)
**Target dose:** 4.5 mg

**Escalation sequence prescribed:**
1. **Step 1:** Finish remaining 3 mg gelules (current stock)
2. **Step 2:** Transition to 2 × 2 mg gelules (= 4 mg) — intermediate step
3. **Step 3:** Start 4.5 mg gelules

**Clinical note:** Gradual dose escalation is appropriate for LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone).
The intermediate 4 mg step provides buffer against side effects during the 3→4.5 mg jump.
Typical LDN escalation timeline: 2–4 weeks per step, depending on tolerance.
Monitor for: sleep disturbances, vivid dreams, transient fatigue during transitions.

### 2. Famotidine 20 mg — NEW, 1×/day

**Prescribed:** Famotidine 20 mg — 1×/day
**Status:** New addition to protocol (not previously taken)

**Mechanism:** H2 histamine receptor blocker — complements H1 antagonist (Rupatall) for broader
mast cell mediator coverage. H1+H2 blockade combination is standard in MCAS management.

**Note:** Famotidine was proposed in a prior AI-generated recommendation but had not been
implemented. Dr. Nicolas is now formally prescribing it.

---

### 3. Rupatall — 3×/day

**Prescribed:** Rupatall 3×/day
**Initially considered:** Bellozal 3×/day — Dr. Nicolas switched to Rupatall

**Doctor's clinical reasoning:** Higher dosage of this class provides better action against SAMA
(Syndrome d'Activation des Mastocytes / Mast Cell Activation Syndrome). The 3×/day regimen
is intentional — it achieves higher cumulative antihistamine exposure for improved mast cell control,
rather than the standard once-daily SAMA/allergy dosing.

ℹ️ **NOTE:** Rupatall is a brand of rupatadine (H1 antagonist + PAF antagonist + mast cell stabilizer).
Bellozal is a brand of bilastine (H1 antagonist — different molecule, no PAF activity).
Dr. Nicolas chose Rupatall over Bellozal, presumably for its broader mast cell mechanism (PAF blockade).

**Replaces:** Current rupatadine 10–20 mg ×1/day protocol.
**Tablet dose:** To confirm at pharmacy.

### 4. DAOSIN — On Demand (with meals)

**Indication:** Histamine intolerance — before meals with high-histamine content
**Mechanism:** Diamine Oxidase (DAO) enzyme — degrades dietary histamine before absorption
**Dosing:** On demand, depending on food content

**Clinical context:** This confirms histamine/MCAS track. DAOSIN is appropriate for meals containing:
- Aged cheeses, fermented foods (yogurt, sauerkraut)
- Cured/smoked meats
- Alcohol (especially wine/beer)
- Fish (especially if not ultra-fresh)
- Spinach, tomatoes, avocado, vinegar

**No interaction risks** with current protocol.

### 5. Montelukast 10 mg — 1×/day

**Mechanism:** Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) — blocks CysLT1/CysLT2 receptors
**Indication:** MCAS add-on — complements antihistamine protocol by targeting leukotriene pathway
**Dosing:** 10 mg once daily (standard adult dose — typically evening)

**Clinical rationale:** Leukotrienes are released by mast cells and eosinophils; adding an LTRA
alongside antihistamines (Rupatadine) and H2 blockers (Famotidine) provides broader mast cell
mediator coverage. This is consistent with current MCAS management recommendations.

**Watch for:** Neuropsychiatric side effects (mood changes, sleep disturbances, agitation)
— uncommon but officially listed. Report to Dr. Nicolas if observed.

**No significant interactions** with current protocol.

### 6. HEMO-HIM-G — NK Cell Support

**Indication:** Reinforcement of NK lymphocytes
**Mechanism:** Korean herbal extract (Angelica gigas, Cnidium officinale, Paeonia japonica combination)
— studied for immune modulation, particularly NK cell activity enhancement
**Relevance to ME/CFS:** NK cell functional impairment is a well-documented finding in ME/CFS;
restoring NK cell activity may reduce immune dysregulation

**Note:** HEMO-HIM has clinical study data from Korean medical literature. Evidence base is
moderate (small RCTs, mostly in cancer/immunosuppressed patients). Rationale is plausible
and risk profile appears low.

**Monitoring:** Track energy, infection frequency, and any immune-related changes.

## Questions to Clarify with Dr. Nicolas

1. Rupatall tablet dose: confirm at pharmacy (then update protocol accordingly).
2. Montelukast: morning or evening dosing preference?
3. HEMO-HIM-G: dosing schedule?
4. LDN escalation: how long at each step before advancing?

## Context for This Visit

Patient presented in good functional state (drove 2h independently, no significant fatigue or
brain fog). This is Day 7 post-Feb 12 crash / Day 4 post-secondary crash. Patient is
currently in recovery/monitoring phase.

The good clinical presentation during consultation may have supported the physician's decision
to escalate LDN and add immunological support (HEMO-HIM-G).
