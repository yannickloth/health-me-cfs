# Case Journal Entry: January 30-31, 2026

**Documentation Date:** 2026-01-31
**Period Covered:** January 30-31, 2026
**Episode Type:** Activity-triggered weakness with recovery phase

---

## Summary

Patient experienced activity-triggered weakness on Jan 30 (cooking), followed by continued weakness and diffuse pain on Jan 31 with high PEM risk. Patient is appropriately limiting activity and prioritizing recovery.

---

## Timeline

### January 30, 2026 - Morning
- **Status:** Good baseline day
- **Energy:** 7/10
- **Head:** OK
- **Medications:** No stimulants
- **Functional status:** Good day

### January 30, 2026 - Afternoon/Evening
- **Trigger event:** Cooking pancakes (30-45 minutes)
- **Onset:** Weakness started DURING cooking activity
- **Response:** Calm evening, sitting at computer (appropriate limitation)
- **Outcome:** Weakness persisted but did not progress to PEM

### January 31, 2026 - Current
- **Status:** Post-activity recovery day
- **Energy:** 3/10 (significantly reduced)
- **Brain fog:** 4/10 ("even head" - cognitive fatigue)
- **Pain:** 5/10, diffuse around joints and muscles
- **Medications:** Provigil (yes), Ritalin (no)
- **PEM risk:** HIGH - patient consciously limiting activity
- **Patient insight:** "Feels at risk of provoking PEM if does too much"

---

## Key Clinical Observations

### 1. Activity Threshold Identification
- **Cooking duration 30-45 minutes exceeded energy envelope**
- This occurred on a "good baseline day" (energy 7/10)
- Suggests activity tolerance is limited even on better days
- Patient has no stimulant support on this day (may have contributed)

### 2. Excellent Self-Awareness
- Patient identified cooking as trigger moment
- Appropriately limited activity after weakness onset
- Prevented escalation from weakness → full PEM
- Recognizing current high PEM risk and acting accordingly

### 3. Pain Pattern
- Diffuse around joints and muscles
- Consistent with post-exertional inflammation
- Resolution timeline: monitoring required

### 4. Medication Strategy
- Using Provigil on Day 2 (recovery support)
- NOT using Ritalin (avoiding stacking stimulants)
- Minimal necessary medication approach

## Additional Observation: Electrolyte-Crash Pattern

**Status:** Preliminary hypothesis from separate episode

### Timeline (from patient report):
- **Day 1 (afternoon, date unknown):** Took electrolytes
- **Day 2 (Thursday morning):** Took electrolytes again
- **Day 2 (Thursday noon, ~3h after dose):** Crash with pain (2.5 hours)
- **Day 2 (Thursday afternoon, post-nap):** Pain resolved relatively quickly

### Patient Hypothesis:
"Sudden increase in ions → enhanced neural signaling → pain"

### Clinical Assessment:
- **Data quality:** Single episode, insufficient for pattern confirmation
- **Plausibility:** Potentially plausible (ion channel dysfunction, neuronal hypersensitivity)
- **Alternative explanations:** Coincidental timing, delayed activity response, orthostatic stress, random fluctuation
- **Recommendation:** Monitor passively, DO NOT modify treatment to test
- **Priority:** Recovery, not experimentation

**This observation has been documented in:** `.claude/case-data/patterns/electrolyte-induced-pain-crash.yaml`

**If pattern repeats, track:**
- Electrolyte formulation and dose
- Timing relative to meals
- Baseline symptom state
- Onset delay from dose
- Concurrent medications
- Hydration status
- Resolution factors

## Management Assessment

### Patient is doing CORRECTLY:
1. Recognizing activity triggers promptly
2. Limiting activity after trigger identification
3. Prioritizing recovery over activity/experimentation
4. Using minimal necessary medication support
5. Demonstrating excellent self-awareness of PEM risk

### Current Priority:
**RECOVERY** - Avoid PEM threshold through activity limitation

### Expected Trajectory:
- **If activity stays minimal:** Recovery in 24-48 hours likely
- **If activity exceeds envelope:** Risk of progression to full PEM

---

## Pacing Implications

### Activity Thresholds Identified:
- Cooking > 30 minutes may require breaks or modifications
- Consider sitting while cooking
- Consider splitting cooking tasks
- Good baseline does not guarantee activity tolerance without stimulant support

### Recovery Strategies:
- Patient correctly using rest as primary intervention
- Appropriate medication support (Provigil without Ritalin stacking)
- Conscious limitation of activity despite potential capacity

## Next Steps

1. **Continue monitoring** Jan 31-Feb 1 for recovery trajectory
2. **Document resolution** when energy returns to baseline
3. **Track activity tolerance** on next good baseline day
4. **If electrolyte pattern repeats:** Document thoroughly with all variables listed above
5. **Update pacing guidelines** based on cooking threshold identification

---

## Alerts

- **PEM_RISK_HIGH:** Patient at high risk of PEM - activity limitation essential
- **APPROPRIATE_MANAGEMENT:** Patient demonstrating good self-awareness and pacing
- **ACTIVITY_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIED:** Cooking 30-45min threshold useful for future pacing
- **HYPOTHESIS_ONLY (electrolytes):** Single episode - insufficient data for pattern confirmation
- **DO_NOT_EXPERIMENT:** Patient priority is recovery - no experimental testing of hypotheses
