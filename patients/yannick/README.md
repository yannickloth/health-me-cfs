## Key Clinical Events

- **Feb 11, 2026**: Acute autonomic dysregulation during sleep-wake transition (critical event requiring investigation)
- **Feb 8-10, 2026**: Activity-triggered PEM and Ritalin MR response sequence
- **Jan 25, 2026**: Upper respiratory infection with severe autonomic exacerbation
- **June 2018**: Head trauma; functional capacity collapsed (pre-severe ME/CFS onset)

## Critical Diagnostic Uncertainty

1. **ADHD vs. Secondary Attention Deficit**: Severe, lifelong attention deficits with excellent stimulant response, but formal ADHD testing negative. Unclear if primary neurodevelopmental disorder or secondary to energy deficit.

2. **Specific Autonomic Syndrome**: Orthostatic symptoms documented, but specific syndrome (POTS, dysautonomia, other) not formally characterized.

3. **Sleep-Autonomic Dysregulation Mechanism**: Recent autonomic event during sleep-wake transition suggests specific vulnerability during sleep transitions; mechanism unknown.

## Primary Research Focus: Fluoride-Pineal-Sleep Hypothesis

**Certainty Assessment**: 0.45 (Moderate; plausible; warrants investigation)

**Core Mechanism**:
- Chronic fluoride exposure → pineal gland calcification → melatonin dysfunction → circadian desynchronization → autonomic dysregulation exacerbation in ME/CFS context

**Testable Predictions**:
1. Melatonin levels will be low (timed salivary melatonin)
2. Sleep architecture will show REM abnormalities (polysomnography)
3. Actigraphy will show circadian desynchronization
4. Autonomic testing will confirm sleep-wake transition dysregulation
5. Melatonin supplementation will improve sleep and reduce autonomic events
6. Fluoride reduction will provide additional benefit (if sources identified)

**Immediate Tests Required**:
- Polysomnography with autonomic monitoring
- Timed salivary melatonin levels (evening, night, morning)
- Two-week continuous actigraphy with light sensor
- Tilt table autonomic function testing

See **07-research-hypotheses.tex** for full hypothesis development and evidence base.

## Integration with Main Document

This patient case is included in the main ME/CFS documentation as:
- **Appendix I**: Case Study of Yannick

The case exemplifies:
- Decades-long disease progression with documented baseline changes
- Complex interaction between ADHD (or energy-deficit secondary cognitive impairment) and ME/CFS
- Sleep dysfunction and autonomic dysregulation in severe ME/CFS
- Activity-triggered PEM patterns and stimulant response characterization
- Testable hypotheses about mechanistic contributions (fluoride-pineal-sleep pathway)

## Physician Review and Recommendations

**Important Medical Disclaimer**: All diagnostic protocols, treatment recommendations, and hypotheses in this documentation are preliminary and require review by qualified physicians before clinical implementation. This case study is for educational purposes and clinical reasoning demonstration.

**Recommended Physician Actions**:
1. Review diagnostic protocols; prioritize testing based on clinical judgment
2. Assess reasonableness of fluoride-pineal hypothesis for this patient
3. Determine appropriate investigation sequence (sleep medicine vs. autonomic vs. metabolic workup)
4. Supervise melatonin supplementation trial if hypothesis-supported
5. Monitor for worsening or new critical events
