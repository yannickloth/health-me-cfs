  ABSTRACT = {Post-infectious myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (PI-ME/CFS) is a disabling disorder, yet the clinical phenotype is poorly defined, the pathophysiology is unknown, and no disease-modifying treatments are available. Using rigorous criteria to recruit PI-ME/CFS participants, we conducted deep phenotyping to identify potential disease mechanisms. A defining feature was an alteration of effort preference, rather than physical or central fatigue, due to dysfunction of integrative brain regions potentially associated with central catechol pathway dysregulation. Immune profiling suggested chronic antigenic stimulation with increase in naïve and decrease in switched memory B-cells. Metabolomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid showed alterations in catecholamine and tryptophan pathway metabolites. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated reduced peak oxygen consumption and chronotropic incompetence. These clinical abnormalities and biomarker differences provide unique insight into the underlying pathophysiology and may guide future interventions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disorder with undefined mechanisms, no diagnostic tools and treatments. To investigate concurrent system dysfunctions, we recruited age- and sex-matched ME/CFS patients and healthy controls for a multimodal analysis of energy metabolism, immune profiles, and plasma proteomics. Immune cells from ME/CFS patients show elevated adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) with a reduced ATP/ADP ratio, indicating decreased ATP generation and cellular energy stress. Immune profiling reveals skewing toward less mature effector subsets. Elevated levels of plasma proteins associated with thrombus formation and vascular reactivity may contribute to the endothelial dysfunction observed in ME/CFS patients. Classification and regression tree modeling identifies variables with strong predictive potential for ME/CFS with AUC 0.962, sensitivity 85.2\%, and specificity 96.7\%.},

@ARTICLE{keller2024cpet,
  ABSTRACT = {Background: The hallmark symptom of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is post-exertional malaise (PEM) defined as worsening symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion, with symptoms typically worsening 12 to 48 h after activity and lasting for days or even weeks. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides an objective method to evaluate this key symptom via a two-day protocol. Methods: 84 ME/CFS participants (Canadian Criteria) and 71 sedentary controls performed two CPETs separated by 24 h. Test measures included peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), work, heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE), and oxygen pulse (O2 pulse). Results: At rest, ME/CFS showed elevated HR and VE compared to controls. During test 1, ME/CFS demonstrated significantly reduced VO2peak, work, VE, O2 pulse and HR compared to controls (p < 0.001 for all). Following 24 h recovery, ME/CFS participants failed to reproduce CPET-1 measures during CPET-2, showing significant declines in all measures (p < 0.05), while control measures were unchanged. Matched subgroup analysis (n = 55 pairs) confirmed that abnormal responses persisted even when controlling for aerobic capacity. Conclusions: Unlike controls, ME/CFS participants show impaired recovery following an exertional stressor. Abnormal CPET responses cannot be explained by fitness alone and implicate disrupted cardiac, pulmonary, and metabolic factors related to autonomic nervous system dysregulation affecting oxygen delivery for energy metabolism.},

  ABSTRACT = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease with a significant societal impact and an estimated prevalence of ~2 million people in the United States. Despite its high prevalence, ME/CFS remains one of the most mysterious diseases in modern medicine. Currently, ME/CFS lacks well-established blood-based biomarkers and is typically diagnosed by clinical history and exclusion of other disorders. Here, we describe an ultrasensitive and accurate assay using a nanoelectronics biosensor that can be used to establish a diagnostic biomarker and a drug-screening platform for ME/CFS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ME/CFS and healthy controls were subjected to hyperosmotic stress and then measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We demonstrated that the assay could accurately identify ME/CFS samples, correctly flagging all 20 ME/CFS patients and none of the 20 healthy controls (P = 4.48E-9). The impedance pattern of ME/CFS samples under hyperosmotic stress showed a unique characteristic that was distinctly different from healthy controls.},

  ABSTRACT = {ME/CFS is a debilitating multisystem disorder of unclear etiology that affects many individuals worldwide with prolonged fatigue following exertion as a hallmark feature. This review examines mitochondrial dysfunction and its potential role in disease pathogenesis, noting similarities with long COVID that suggest underlying dysfunction in energy production in both conditions. Research documents lower mitochondrial metabolism and ATP synthesis rates in ME/CFS patients' skeletal muscles, alongside increased intracellular acidosis consistent with more glycolytic activity. Studies reveal elevated levels of lipid peroxidation products, protein carbonyls, and oxidized DNA bases combined with reduced antioxidants like coenzyme Q10. Recent findings highlight WASF3 as mediating mitochondrial dysfunction through ER stress pathways.},
