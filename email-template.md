## Notes on Adaptation

**Always customize:**
- The "why I'm sharing" section (show you understand their context)
- Key sections highlighted (match their interests/needs)
- Tone (more personal for patients, more formal for clinicians)

**Consider mentioning:**
- Specific chapters if you know their particular interest
- That it's free/open access (removes barriers)
- That it includes both mechanisms and practical guidance
- That citations are extensive (for those who want to verify)

**Avoid:**
- Medical advice (especially to patients - emphasize physician consultation)
- Overpromising treatment effectiveness
- Academic jargon when writing to patients or press
- Being too casual when writing to clinicians or researchers
